The Asian Thoracic Oncology Research Group (ATORG) was formed in 2016 with the vision to be the central coordinating platform for multi-centre clinical trials and translational research for thoracic malignancies in the Asia-Pacific region.

Recent advances in medical science have led doctors and scientists to recognize that lung cancer is diverse and made up of molecular subsets of diseases. Work has begun to identify these sub-types of cancer so that collaborative studies can be initiated to uncover the types of treatment that can benefit each subgroup of patients.

ATORGâ€™s mission is to advance medical knowledge of lung cancer and improve health outcomes of patients in Asia through clinical research, advisory board meetings and educational events.

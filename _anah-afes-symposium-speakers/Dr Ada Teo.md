<h3>Dr Ada Teo</h3>
<p><strong>MBBChir (Cambridge), MRCP (UK), MMed (Int Med), PhD (Cambridge)</strong>
</p>
<p>Associate Consultant, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine,
National University Health Systems (NUHS), Singapore</p>
<h4>Profile</h4>
<p>Having completed the Cambridge MB-PhD programme under the Agency for Science,
Technology and Research (A*STAR), Dr Ada Teo is currently a Senior Resident
at National University Hospital. She has also been appointed Clinical Lecturer
under the NUS Clinical Faculty Scheme. Her research is focused on the molecular
genetics of hypertension, in particular aldosterone-producing adenomas.
This led to the discovery of a subtype of adenomas with hallmark somatic
mutations and a genotype-phenotype correlation. This work enabled both
clinical insight and research expertise to be intertwined, with patients
benefiting from, and contributing to, research into their own hypertension-
culminating in her first publication in the New England Journal of Medicine
in 2015.</p>

<h3>Dr Ada Teo</h3>
<p><strong>MBBChir (Cambridge), MRCP (UK), MMed (Int Med), PhD (Cambridge)</strong>
</p>
<p>Associate Consultant, Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine,
National University Health Systems (NUHS), Singapore</p>
<h4>Profile</h4>
<p>Having completed the Cambridge MB-PhD programme, Dr Ada Teo is currently
an Associate Consultant in Endocrinology at National University Hospital
Singapore. Her research focuses on the molecular genetics of endocrine
hypertension, particularly primary aldosteronism. This led to the observation
of a genotype-phenotype correlation in aldosterone-producing adenomas and
subsequent discovery of a novel subtype with hallmark somatic mutations <em>(First-author publication in NEJM, 2015)</em>.
This work intertwines research with clinical insight, empowering patients
to contribute to hypertension research while concurrently improving patient
care. Her recent review on molecular imaging in primary aldosteronism was
recently published in JCEM in July 2025.</p>

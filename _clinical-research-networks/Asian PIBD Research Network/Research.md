**Ongoing Study:**

*   Asian Registry on Childhood Inflammatory Bowel Disease
    
    Clinical data regarding clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, endoscopic evaluation and histology and management of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at National University Hospital and collaborative study sites (local and regional) would be stored in this database.
    
    The goals of the registry would be to identify disease patterns amongst the Asian PIBD cohort and to pool valuable clinical data that would be of scientific interest to the global community managing IBD. A registry also allows for more accurate analysis of specific patient subgroups, e.g. very early-onset Crohn’s disease, which would be of rare incidence in individual centres.  A common registry platform would also enable individual medical centres to standardise how the clinical course of PIBD is characterised, and enable a meaningful comparison between regional and global PIBD data. Information obtained from the registry would allow individual clinicians and hospitals across Asia to monitor short-term and long-term patient outcomes, adverse events after treatment, thus improving management strategies and allowing for better healthcare services to be designed for PIBD.

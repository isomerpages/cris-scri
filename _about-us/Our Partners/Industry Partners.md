At the **Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI)**, our commitment extends beyond academic and public sector collaborations. We recognize the vital role that the industry partnerships play in advancing clinical research, and we actively engage with a diverse range of industry stakeholders to drive innovation and excellence. 

One of the notable collaborations is our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Oncoshot, a leading platform in the field of oncology. The collaboration between SCRI and Oncoshot aims to streamline the process of patient recruitment for clinical trials, ensuring that more patients have access to cutting-edge treatments and therapies. 

In addition, SCRI actively supports trials from pharmaceutical companies, Contract Research Organizations (CRO) and biotech firms. We are also a staunch supporter of the Singapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries (SAPI) and take pride in conducting the yearly clinical research roundtable with our SAPI counterparts.

Our commitment to the industry is evident in our endeavours to uplift the standards of Clinical Research Professionals (CRP), ensuring that they are equipped with the knowledge and skills to lead the next wave of clinical innovations.  We support and work with the Singapore Clinical Research Professionals (SCRP) Association.

By forging strong ties with our industry partners, SCRI is not only enhancing the clinical research landscape in Singapore but also making significant strides in global healthcare advancements.

The Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) is a national academic research organization that plays a pivotal role in enhancing the standards of clinical research capabilities in Singapore. 

Our partnerships extend to various public sector entities that play pivotal roles in the clinical research landscape. We work closely with regulatory authorities such as the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to ensure our research adheres to the highest standards of safety and ethics. We support Investigator-Initiated Trials (IIT) through collaborations with public healthcare clusters, including the National Healthcare Group (NHG), SingHealth and the National University Health System (NUHS). This allows us to conduct research in real-world healthcare settings, ensuring relevance and impact of the research. 

Furthermore, our ties with the Investigational Medicine Unit (IMU) and Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) have been instrumental in enhancing our research capabilities. We work hand-in-hand with IMU and CTU in providing specialized expertise and infrastructure that enable Singapore to undertake complex clinical trials and studies, furthering our mission to improve patient outcomes.

An avid supporter of the Local Clinical Trials Grant (LCG) and Clinical Trials Grant (CTG) initiatives from the National Medical Research Council (NMRC), SCRI has been instrumental in fostering a vibrant clinical research ecosystem in Singapore. Through our unwavering commitment to these grants, we have facilitated numerous grant-funded research projects, enabling clinicians and researchers to translate their innovative ideas into tangible clinical studies that benefit patients. By bridging the gap between funding and expertise, SCRI has played a pivotal role in ensuring that these trials adhere to international standards of quality, safety, and ethics. 

On the research front, SCRI have also forged strong relationships with institutes of higher learning, such as National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Duke-NUS as well as national research agencies such as Agency for Science, Research and Technology (A\*STAR).

We also work with the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) to drive the growth of the clinical research industry in Singapore. By collaborating with EDB and ESG, we hope to attract investments, develop talents and create jobs in the clinical research sector. 

Our collaboration with the Biomedical Sciences Industry Partnership Offices (BMS IPO) to facilitate partnerships between public sector research institutions and the biomedical sciences industry. This helps to ensure that promising research can be translated into products and services that benefit patients. 

Lastly, as a business unit under the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, we expand our reach and capabilities to support our sister business units in multiple areas of clinical research. 

With a robust infrastructure, a team of dedicated professionals, and a network of invaluable partnerships, SCRI is well-positioned to lead Singapore to new heights in clinical research in the coming years.

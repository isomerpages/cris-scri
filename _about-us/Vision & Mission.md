<p>Clinical trials are essential for turning scientific discoveries into
better patient care. They help bring new treatments to those who need them,
generate evidence that guides clinical practice, and support health policy
through data-driven decisions. Singapore’s long-term commitment to research
and development has built a strong clinical research environment with high-quality
infrastructure, rigorous standards and a skilled workforce, positioning
the country as a trusted centre for medical innovation.</p>
<p>As a national entity supporting and coordinating clinical trials in Singapore,
SCRI plays a central role in strengthening the clinical research ecosystem.
We focus on enhancing capabilities, improving coordination across stakeholders
and addressing sector-wide gaps so that clinical trials can deliver meaningful
benefits. This mission is enabled by the breadth of expertise across SCRI,
spanning clinical research operations, infrastructure support, networks,
partnerships with academic and industry collaborators, and capability building
through training and education. Together, we support impactful research
and help ensure Singapore remains a vibrant and competitive location for
clinical trials.</p>
<p>As global competition for clinical research grows and healthcare continues
to evolve, SCRI will continue to foster collaboration, adopt innovative
approaches and develop talent across the ecosystem. Working alongside our
partners, we aim to realise the full potential of clinical trials to improve
patient outcomes and help shape the future of healthcare in Singapore and
beyond.</p>

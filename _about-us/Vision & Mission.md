Clinical trials bridge the gap between scientific discovery and better patient care. They bring new treatments to patients, generate the evidence that guides medical practice, and inform health policy through data-driven decisions. Singapore’s long-term commitment to research and development has built a strong clinical research environment with high-quality infrastructure, rigorous standards and a skilled workforce, positioning the country as a trusted centre for medical innovation.

As the national coordinating body for clinical trials in Singapore, SCRI plays a central role in strengthening the ecosystem. We focus on enhancing capabilities, improving coordination and addressing sector-wide gaps so that clinical trials can deliver meaningful benefits. This mission is made possible by the diverse expertise of our people, including clinical trial specialists, project managers, health economists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, regulatory and data professionals, and operations teams. Together, we enable impactful research and help ensure that Singapore has the capabilities needed for a vibrant and competitive clinical trials landscape.

As global competition for clinical research grows and healthcare evolves, SCRI will continue to support collaboration, adopt innovative approaches and develop talent across the ecosystem. Working alongside our partners, we aim to realise the full potential of clinical trials to improve patient outcomes and help shape the future of healthcare in Singapore and beyond.

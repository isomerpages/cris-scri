In mid-2019, a **Clinical Trials Strategy Committee (CTSC)** was set up and tasked to review the current clinical trials landscape and propose recommendations for a national clinical trials strategy to provide focus and to optimise clinical trials resources. The Human Health and Potential Executive Committee (HHP EXCO) had approved the recommendations, including the establishment of the National Clinical Trial Strategy Committee (NCTSC) to oversee the implementation of the national strategy for clinical trials and coordinate efforts across the healthcare clusters and industry. The NCTSC will provide strategic oversight and guidance on this work and will be staffed by the National Coordinating Office (NCO).Â 

  

The responsibilities of the NCO include being the national clinical trial coordinator. This would involve being a one-stop-shop providing unified ancillary clinical trial logistics to support the development of master clinical trial agreements, clinical trial contracts and facilitate budget negotiations to shorten the start-up time of multi-site trials in Singapore; and provided with the mandate to define success goals, monitor performance of clinical trials, and work with relevant agencies to review and propose policy changes to facilitate the conduct of clinical trials for promising therapeutic entities in Singapore.

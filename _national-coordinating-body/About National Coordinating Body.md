<p>In mid-2019, a <strong>Clinical Trials Strategy Committee (CTSC)</strong> was
set up and tasked to review the current clinical trials landscape and propose
recommendations for a national clinical trials strategy to provide focus
and to optimise clinical trials resources. The Human Health and Potential
Executive Committee (HHP EXCO) had approved the recommendations, including
the establishment of the National Clinical Trial Strategy Committee (NCTSC)
to oversee the implementation of the national strategy for clinical trials
and coordinate efforts across the healthcare clusters and industry. The
NCTSC will provide strategic oversight and guidance on this work and will
be staffed by the National Clinical Trials Coordinating Office (NCO).</p>
<p>The main responsibility of the NCO would be to take on the role of the
national clinical trials coordinator. This would involve taking on the
responsibilities to shorten the start-up time of multi-site trials in Singapore
and to be given the mandate to define success goals, monitor performance
of clinical trials, and work with relevant agencies to review and propose
policy changes to facilitate the conduct of clinical trials for promising
therapeutic entities in Singapore.</p>

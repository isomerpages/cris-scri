In mid-2019, a **Clinical Trials Strategy Committee (CTSC)** was set up and tasked to review the current clinical trials landscape and propose recommendations for a national clinical trials strategy to provide focus and to optimise clinical trials resources. The Human Health and Potential Executive Committee (HHP EXCO) had approved the recommendations, including the establishment of the National Clinical Trial Strategy Committee (NCTSC) to oversee the implementation of the national strategy for clinical trials and coordinate efforts across the healthcare clusters and industry. The NCTSC will provide strategic oversight and guidance on this work and will be staffed by the National Clinical Trials Coordinating Office (NCO). 

The main responsibility of the NCO would be to take on the role of the national clinical trials coordinator. This would involve taking on the responsibilities to shorten the start-up time of multi-site trials in Singapore and to be given the mandate to define success goals, monitor performance of clinical trials, and work with relevant agencies to review and propose policy changes to facilitate the conduct of clinical trials for promising therapeutic entities in Singapore.

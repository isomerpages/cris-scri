**Master Clinical Trial Agreement**
===================================

**What is the Master Clinical Trial Agreement (MCTA)?**

The MCTA is an initiative by SCRI to expedite the contracting of clinical trials conducted in Singapore by shortening the agreement review time. The clauses in the MCTA have been pre-negotiated between the legal entities from the 3 public healthcare clusters (Singapore Health Services, National Health Group and National University Health System) and Singapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries (SAPI).

**Who should be using the MCTA?**

Sponsors interested in conducting clinical trials with public institutions across healthcare clusters will find the MCTA to be very useful as it contains pre-negotiated clauses agreed by the healthcare clusters. The MCTA is also useful as a guide for biotechs and new start-ups.

**How to use the MCTA?**

The MCTA is a live document that can be downloaded in editable form. Users can use the MCTA as is or can adopt the individual clauses into existing agreements. If users are using the MCTA as is, additional requirements to the study can be added to the SCHEDULE, which can be found at the end of the MCTA document.

**What should you do if you have any feedback?**

If you have any questions or if you would like to provide feedback about the MCTA, please emailÂ [contact@scri.cris.sg](mailto:contact@scri.cris.sg). Our team will be on hand to address any queries.

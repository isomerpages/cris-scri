<p><strong>Clinical trial start-up time</strong> is one of the key considerations
when performing site selection for clinical trials. It includes time taken
for clinical trial agreement negotiations, IRB approval, regulatory approval
and site startup. The time taken for negotiating the clinical trial agreements
can go up to six (6) months.</p>
<p>To address the slow contracting time due to legal issues, cost negotiations
and response time, NCO has developed a master clinical trial agreement
(MCTA) template for sponsored trials together with the Singapore Association
for Pharmaceutical Industries (SAPI) and the three (3) public sector healthcare
clusters (Singapore Health Services, National Health Group and National
University Health System) to shorten contract review time. The terms and
conditions in the MCTA template have been pre-negotiated between SAPI and
the three (3) public sector healthcare clusters.</p>
<p><strong>Who should be using the MCTA?</strong>
</p>
<p>Sponsors interested in conducting clinical trials with public institutions
across healthcare clusters will find the MCTA to be very useful as it contains
pre-negotiated terms and conditions agreed by the healthcare clusters.
The MCTA is also useful as a guide for biotechs and new start-ups.</p>
<p><strong>How to use the MCTA?</strong>
</p>
<p>The MCTA is a live document that can be downloaded in editable form. Users
can use the MCTA as is or can adopt the individual clauses into existing
agreements. If users are using the MCTA as is, additional requirements
to the study can be added to the SCHEDULE, which can be found at the end
of the MCTA document.</p>

<p>The <strong>Clinical Trial Enhancement Process</strong> involves refining
and optimizing various aspects of clinical trials to ensure its effectiveness
and reliability. This iterative process includes reviewing trial startup
processes, trial protocols, participant recruitment strategies, data collection
methods, and statistical analysis plans. Enhancement might also focus on
minimizing biases, improving patient safety and increasing the trial’s
overall efficiency. Regular evaluations and adjustments help trialists
and researchers identify potential challenges and implement necessary improvements,
ultimately leading to more robust and informative clinical trial outcomes.</p>
<h4>Singapore's Clinical Trial Portal - CTSG</h4>
<p>CTSG serves as Singapore’s centralised portal for all things related to
clinical trials. Crafted to cater to patients, caregivers, clinical investigators
and corporations alike, CTSG is dedicated to make clinical trial information
more accessible and understandable. By demystifying the clinical trial
landscape, CTSG hopes to encourage greater interest in clinical trials,
fostering innovation and improving health outcomes. Click <a href="https://clinicaltrials.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here </a>for

<h4>Early Phase Community of Practice</h4>
<p>In RIE2025, early phase clinical trials have been identified as a focus
area for the Singapore clinical trials ecosystem. It was highlighted that
this would facilitate building up a cadre of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs)
within the ecosystem, as well as enhance the know-how and capabilities
within the three public healthcare clusters to conduct the more complex
and sophisticated Phase I &amp; Phase II clinical trials that are crucial
for the development of therapeutics and medical devices.</p>
<p>Singapore’s strategic focus on building expertise in early phase clinical
trials and creating a favourable environment for clinical research will
not only lead to economic benefits, but also contribute to the advancement
of medical science and patient care. By fostering a robust early phase
clinical trial community of practice, Singapore can establish itself as
a leading hub for healthcare, innovative research and pharmaceutical development.</p>
<p>To align with RIE2025 directions, the Singapore Clinical Research Institute
(SCRI) will work with the early phase clinical trial units in the three
public healthcare clusters to coordinate efforts at a national level so
as to avoid duplication of efforts and achieve a level of synergy.</p>
<h4>Public Awareness Campaign</h4>
<p>Clinical trials are essential for developing new and effective treatments
and improving the quality of life for patients. One of the biggest barriers
in clinical trial is public awareness. Most people are not aware of what
clinical trials involve and why they matter. They are not aware that clinical
research can be an accessible and viable treatment options.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the clinical trial information are often written
in technical jargon with complicated concepts which patients cannot relate
to, and such information are often presented in a way that is difficult
to digest for general public. When patients do not understand what their
involvement would be, how the trial would be conducted and what are the
benefits for participating in clinical trials, it is unlikely that they
would sign up for a trial.</p>
<p>As such, it is important to raise public awareness for clinical trials
and improve clinical research literacy.</p>
<p>SCRI is working on a public awareness campaign for clinical trials to
reach out to public proactively as an national effort.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Objective:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To raise awareness and improve the perception on clinical trials among
the patients and public by educating them on the rights, benefits and risk
when participating in a clinical trial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Secondary Objective:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To aid in increasing subject recruitment rate.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Engaging Clinical Research Ecosystem in Singapore</h4>

<p>Besides being a national academic research organisation dedicated to enhancing
the standards of clinical research in Singapore by developing core capabilities,
infrastructure and scientific leadership for clinical research, SCRI is
also work closely with the healthcare clusters, government agencies, regulatory
bodies, industry partners, CROs and service providers to enhance Singapore’s
clinical research ecosystem, foster public-private collaborations as well
as provide leadership in the operational and methodological aspects of
clinical trials. These efforts have helped Singapore become a more attractive
place to private sector investors and will continue to contribute to the
enhancement of the local clinical trials landscape in the years to come.</p>

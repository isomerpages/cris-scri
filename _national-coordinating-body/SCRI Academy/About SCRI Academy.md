<h4>What is a Clinical Research Coordinator?</h4>
<p>Clinical research fuels revolutionary progress in medicine, pushing patient
care to unparalleled heights of excellence. The linchpin of each successful
clinical research study is the Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), ensuring
smooth, ethical and efficient conduct of the studies.</p>
<p>Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) is a specialized research professional
that manages the daily clinical trial activities under the direction of
the Principal Investigator (PI). They assist the PI in coordinating and
managing the conduct of the clinical trial, developing study materials
and tools, recruiting participants, managing data, budget,&nbsp;and ensuring
compliance with the relevant policies and regulatory requirements. CRCs
also act as liaisons between the study sponsor, PI, and other research
staff. They also prepare and maintain study documentation and coordinate
communication among stakeholders. Possessing strong organizational and
communication skills is essential for CRCs to progress in their careers.</p>

<h4>SCRI Academy -National Learning and Development Platform for CRCs</h4>
<p>The SCRI Academy was launched on 29 August 2017 by Dr Lam Pin Min, Senior
Minister State for Health, to serve as Singapore’s first national learning
and development platform for the CRCs.</p>
<p>The aims of the SCRI Academy include:</p>
<p>•Implement the National CRC Learning and Development Initiative</p>
<p>•Form partnerships with local and overseas training providers</p>
<p>•Implement training and certification programmes for clinical research
professionals.</p>
<p>Skilled Clinical Research Coordinators play an important role in supporting
research investigators in the execution of quality clinical research. Maintaining
a well-trained talent pool of CRCs was critical in Singapore’s pursuit
to be a leading centre for healthcare innovation, as well as retaining
its attractiveness as a site for clinical trials.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SCRI Academy/Picture3.png">
</div>
<p>In 2017, the Ministry of Health tasked SCRI with the implementation of
national training programmes for CRCs and set aside funding for development
of CRCs. SCRI consulted the Subject Matter Experts, such as Health Sciences
Authority (HSA), and collaborated with various local and overseas education
partners to develop a series of structured national CRC training programmes.</p>
<p>The series of structured programmes by SCRI Academy provides a stepwise
training for the CRCs to improve on their clinical research knowledge and
skills to support their career progression.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Apart from understanding the requirements, policies and regulations involved
in the conduct of a clinical trial, it is also vital for the CRCs to have
the ability to apply the theoretical concepts to real-life situations.
Therefore, the programmes were designed with comprehensive practice-based
activities, case scenarios, demonstrations and classroom discussions to
reinforce the application work.</p>

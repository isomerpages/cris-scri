# What is a Clinical Research Coordinator?

   

Clinical research fuels revolutionary progress in medicine, pushing patient care to unparalleled heights of excellence. The linchpin of each successful clinical research study is the Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), ensuring smooth, ethical and efficient conduct of the studies.

Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) is a specialized research professional that manages the daily clinical trial activities under the direction of the Principal Investigator (PI). They assist the PI in coordinating and managing the conduct of the clinical trial, developing study materials and tools, recruiting participants, managing data, budget,  and ensuring compliance with the relevant policies and regulatory requirements. CRCs also act as liaisons between the study sponsor, PI, and other research staff. They also prepare and maintain study documentation and coordinate communication among stakeholders. Possessing strong organizational and communication skills is essential for CRCs to progress in their careers.

   

# SCRI Academy -National Learning and Development Platform for CRCs

   

The SCRI Academy was launched on 29 August 2017 by Dr Lam Pin Min, Senior Minister State for Health, to serve as Singapore’s first national learning and development platform for the CRCs.

The aims of the SCRI Academy include:

•Implement the National CRC Learning and Development Initiative

•Form partnerships with local and overseas training providers

•Implement training and certification programmes for clinical research professionals.


Skilled Clinical Research Coordinators play an important role in supporting research investigators in the execution of quality clinical research. Maintaining a well-trained talent pool of CRCs was critical in Singapore’s pursuit to be a leading centre for healthcare innovation, as well as retaining its attractiveness as a site for clinical trials.

In 2017, the Ministry of Health tasked SCRI with the implementation of national training programmes for CRCs and set aside funding for development of CRCs. SCRI consulted the Subject Matter Experts, such as Health Sciences Authority (HSA), and collaborated with various local and overseas education partners to develop a series of structured national CRC training programmes.

The series of structured programmes by SCRI Academy provides a stepwise training for the CRCs to improve on their clinical research knowledge and skills to support their career progression.

  Apart from understanding the requirements, policies and regulations involved in the conduct of a clinical trial, it is also vital for the CRCs to have the ability to apply the theoretical concepts to real-life situations. Therefore, the programmes were designed with comprehensive practice-based activities, case scenarios, demonstrations and classroom discussions to reinforce the application work.

Apart from understanding the requirements, policies and regulations involved in the conduct of a clinical trial, it is also vital for the CRCs to have the ability to apply the theoretical concepts to real-life situations. Therefore, the programmes were designed with comprehensive practice-based activities, case scenarios, demonstrations and classroom discussions to reinforce the application work.

Below are the National CRC Training and Certification Programmes:

*   **CRC Level 1 Programme:**&nbsp;A 7-week training course that offers a comprehensive introduction to the on-site operations of clinical trials from protocol feasibility to study start-up, ethics and regulation, recruitment and study closure. It is targeted at CRCs with less than a year of experience. Click&nbsp;[here](/news-and-events/news/clinical-research-coordinator-level-1-programme/) &nbsp;for more details.
    
*   **CRC Level 2 Programme:**&nbsp;A 6-day training course that empower CRCs with project management skills and the ability to coordinate investigator-initiated clinical research studies with reasonable degree of proficiency across a range of study designs. It is targeted at Senior CRCs or equivalent with at least 2 years of experience in coordinating clinical research studies and performing subject recruitment, informed consent and/or subject follow-up.

*   **CRC Level 3 Programme:** &nbsp;An advance 4\-day training course designed to develop the essential capabilities critical to the role of a Senior CRC in supporting the management in planning the departmental activities and managing a clinical research team. The programme covers the key operational, leadership and technical elements related to clinical research operation. It is targeted at Senior CRCs and above with at least 5 years of experience in coordinating clinical research studies, who are also involved in conducting quality compliance check and developing study documents and workflow.

In addition to the structured training programmes, SCRI Academy also provides other training workshops and awards to recognize the CRCs effort in contributing to Singapore clinical research ecosystem.

*   **CRC Lunch Workshop (free)**&nbsp;To ensure the CRCs stay abreast of the latest updates and trends in clinical research ecosystem, speakers from the regulatory, public healthcare institutes and commercial multinational corporations were invited to share about various aspects of clinical trial management and their best practices with the CRCs. This light-hearted annual lunch workshop provides an opportunity for the CRCs from different public healthcare institutes to mingle, network and gain deeper insights on industry best practices.

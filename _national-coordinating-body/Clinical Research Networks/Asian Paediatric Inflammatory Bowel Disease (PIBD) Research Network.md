**About Asian PIBD Research Network**
=====================================

The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been steadily rising in Asia over recent years. Postulated etiologic factors include a shift in dietary patterns, environment and lifestyle towards that of the urbanised Western population. While there is a growing amount of published epidemiological data in adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease, the clinicopathological characteristics of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) are unique and may not be extrapolated from adult literature.

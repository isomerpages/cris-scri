**About PACCMAN**
=================

**What is PACCMAN?**

PACCMAN (Pediatric Acute & Critical Care Medicine Asian Network) is a collaborative research network formed in 2015 by pediatric intensive care providers. Currently, pediatric intensive care research is inadequate and poorly coordinated in Asia due to variations in clinical practice, institutional systems and resources. With conditions like sepsis, ARDS and myocarditis which carry high mortality rates, the scarcity of trends and research in this area underscores the need for collaboration and good quality interventional trials. The primary aim of PACCMAN is to promote collaboration by bringing together individuals to share experience and develop best practices for this diverse region.

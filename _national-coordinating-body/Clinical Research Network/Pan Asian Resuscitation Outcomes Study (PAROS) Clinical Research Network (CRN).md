**About PAROS**
===============

The PAROS CRN is a collaborative research group formed in 2010 by dedicated Pre-hospital and Emergency Care (PEC) providers conducting PEC research in the Asia-Pacific region. It promotes&nbsp;collaboration by bringing together like-minded individuals to share experiences and develop joint initiatives for the betterment of PEC.

Currently, research into PEC in the Asia-Pacific region is largely inadequate and poorly coordinated owing to the marked variations in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems and outcomes reporting. With PEC conditions such as Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) being one of the leading causes of death worldwide, the dearth in the understanding of trends andÂ  research in PEC underscores the urgent need for more collaborative research and good-quality intervention trials in PEC.

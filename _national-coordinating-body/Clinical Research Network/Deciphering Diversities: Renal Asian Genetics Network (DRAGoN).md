**About DRAGoN**
================
DRAGoN stands for “Deciphering Diversities: Renal Asian Genetics Network”. It is a research consortium based in National University of Singapore, set up to investigate glomerular and proteinuric diseases in Asians. The network consists of nephrologists, paediatricians, pathologists scientists and biostatisticians.

**_Why is DRAGoN set up?_**

Primary glomerular disease, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), is a common cause of renal failure in adults and children worldwide. Current treatment strategies are largely empirical and involve the use of immunosuppressive drugs which are often non-targeted, toxic and expensive. Yet, response rates are not always desirable.

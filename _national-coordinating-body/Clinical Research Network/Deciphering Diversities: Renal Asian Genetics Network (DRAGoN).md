It is a research consortium based in National University of Singapore, set up to investigate glomerular and proteinuric diseases in Asians. The network consists of nephrologists, paediatricians, pathologists scientists and biostatisticians.</p><p><strong><em>Why is DRAGoN set up?</em></strong></p><p>Primary glomerular disease, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), is a common cause of renal failure in adults and children worldwide.

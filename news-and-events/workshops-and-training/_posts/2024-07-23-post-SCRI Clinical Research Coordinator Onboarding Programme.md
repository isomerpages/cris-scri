<p>The CRC Onboarding Programme is a 2 half-day programme designed to support
CRCs with less than 1 year of experience. Upon completion of the programme,
you will be able to apply theoretical knowledge in practice and navigate
basic CRC duties with ease, ensuring that studies are conducted according
to the relevant guidelines and policies. Additionally, you will be placed
in a support group (over 7 weeks) and receive further guidance from SCRI
trainers to address any clinical research-related questions.</p>

<p>
<br><strong>SINGAPORE, 30 July 2024 </strong>–&nbsp;Clinical trials are at
the heart of medical advancements, where many of the advancements in the
treatment of serious diseases have been made possible through clinical
trials. Today, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of
the National Research Foundation, launched the <a href="http://ClinicalTrials.SG" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.SG</a> (CTSG). CTSG is a
comprehensive centralised clinical trials portal for patients and caregivers,
clinical investigators, and clinical trial sponsors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Led by the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI), the launch of
the CTSG portal marks a significant step towards making clinical trials
more accessible for more people. This initiative seeks to demystify clinical
trials by providing easy to understand information about clinical research
for the public and drive clinical research excellence in Singapore by meeting
the diverse needs of the clinical research community.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Key Features of ClinicalTrials.SG</u>
</p>
<p>Overview&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Comprehensive clinical trials resource for all: </strong>a centralised
clinical trials portal offering easy to understand information on clinical
trials for patients / caregivers and clinical research professionals. The
platform emphasises the importance of clinical trials, outlines the processes
involved in clinical trials and regulatory frameworks in place to safeguard
patient safety and clinical trial efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>For patients / caregivers&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A platform dedicated to empowering the public to discover and participate in healthcare innovation: </strong>Recognising
the pivotal role of patients, caregivers, and healthy volunteers in clinical
research for medical advancement, CTSG provides a comprehensive introduction
to clinical research and provides information about ongoing trials in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>For Clinical research professionals&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A portal that accelerates collaboration opportunities for clinical research professionals: </strong>The
centralised clinical trials portal not only provides comprehensive information
on ongoing trials but also serves as a hub for collaboration, linking researchers
with academic and industry partners to foster innovation and advance clinical
research. It includes details on regulatory and ethics requirements for
clinical&nbsp;trials. Additionally, the portal offers information on available
research grants in Singapore, training opportunities, and a directory of
available clinical research resources such as Contract Research Organisations
(CROs), Clinical Development and Manufacturing Organisations (CDMOs), laboratories,
software platforms, and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. This wide
array of resources&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Biorepository resource for clinical investigators and clinical trial sponsors: </strong>This
resource is a consolidated database featuring local and overseas specimens
and imaging data specifically tailored for cardiovascular, oncology research,
and other scientific studies. It offers clinical researchers and trial
sponsors a wealth of data for their studies. This feature enhances research
efficiency and facilitates further robust and clinical research studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy-to-use search engine with search and filter capabilities: </strong>Users
can search for clinical trials based on specific health conditions, making
it easier to find relevant trials quickly and efficiently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.SG</a> will
be unveiled at the SCRI Clinical Trials Symposium 2024 which is themed
“The Promise of Clinical Trials: Transforming Tomorrow’s Health.” The two-day
inaugural symposium (30 to 31 July 2024) organised by SCRI marks a significant
milestone for the Singapore research ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The symposium brings together 500 clinicians, researchers, academics,
and industry experts in clinical research and trials from both the public
and private sector, and includes patients and clinical trial participants,
coming together in a collaborative effort to advance clinical research.
It also offers an excellent opportunity for knowledge exchange and networking
among healthcare leaders, patient advocates, and regulatory representatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The symposium is a first of its kind here in Singapore for the clinical
research community, which features sessions that delve into the impact
of patient advocacy groups and community involvement in advancing clinical
research, and the role of clinical trials in driving improved health outcomes
and their potential to boost the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Patient advocacy is increasingly vital in clinical research, ensuring
that patient perspectives shape trial design and implementation. Patient
insights into needs and experiences enhance research relevance and effectiveness.
Integrating patient voices aligns with ethical standards, and regulators
are recognising its importance, developing guidelines to support patient
involvement in research and trials.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local clinical trials offer early access to innovative therapies, benefiting
patients in Singapore. These trials also generate economic value, attracting
investments in biomedical sciences and creating job opportunities. Research
outcomes inform clinicians and health systems on effective strategies for
diseases like cancer and infectious diseases, leading to evidence-based
guidelines and improved patient care. The data collected from clinical
trials can be used to generate evidence-based guidelines which will shape
clinical practices and treatment standards, leading to better patient care.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adj A/Prof Danny Soon, Chief Executive Officer of the Consortium for Clinical
Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS), and Executive Director of SCRI
said, "The launch of <a href="http://ClinicalTrials.SG" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.SG</a> is a significant milestone
in our ongoing efforts to support clinical research and improve patient
and healthcare outcomes in Singapore. Clinical trials contribute significantly
to the development of new therapies and treatments. Therefore, by making
clinical trial information more accessible and easier to understand, we
hope to encourage greater awareness on clinical trials among the public
and enhance collaboration for clinical research professionals.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof John Lim, Chairman, Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation,
Singapore (CRIS) said, “SCRI is committed to providing the necessary infrastructure
to facilitate clinical research. In recent years, SCRI has focused on strategic
initiatives aimed at supporting and nurturing clinical research competencies
within Singapore. The launch of the centralised clinical trials portal,
<a href="http://ClinicalTrials.SG" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.SG</a>is a welcome development for the clinical research
ecosystem and is testament of SCRI’s deep-seated mission to advance clinical
research towards improved health outcomes for our patients in Singapore”.
Prof Lim is also Senior Advisor at the Ministry of Health and Executive
Director of the Centre of Regulatory Excellence (CoRE), Duke-NUS Medical
School.&nbsp;</p>

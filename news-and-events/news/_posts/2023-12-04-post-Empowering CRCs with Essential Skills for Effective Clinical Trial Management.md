<p><strong>Clinical Research Coordinator Level 1 Programme (September 2023 intake)</strong>
</p>
<p>Clinical research coordinators (CRC) play a pivotal role in running clinical
trials, managing various responsibilities daily to ensure the smooth progress
of the clinical research study. Their duties encompass a wide range of
tasks, including participant recruitment and screening, and at times, even
being an advocate for the participant.</p>
<p>CRCs are required to collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, ensure
adherence to study protocols, ethical guidelines, and regulatory requirements.
For junior CRCs, the learning curve can be steep in their early career.</p>
<p>Since 2018, SCRI Academy has been conducting the CRC Level 1 Programme
for junior CRCs with less than a year of experience in conducting clinical
trials to support their career development in this profession.</p>
<p>This Level 1 programme, which is run every March and September, aims to
support CRCs in navigating the complexities of clinical trial management
and to equip them with vital skills for the efficient running and administration
of clinical trials.</p>
<p>This course provides a strong foundation for CRCs to learn the ropes on
how to effectively carry out the above duties mentioned, as well as gauge
protocol feasibility, draw up study budgets, conduct safety reporting to
site closure.</p>

<p>Submitting grant proposals can be an arduous process for some. To better equip principal investigators (PIs) and research officers with the skills to navigate this challenge, SCRI organises Grant Enhancement Training (GET) workshops every year.</p><p>&nbsp;On 18 and 25 May 2023, in partnership with the Geriatric Education &amp; Research Institute (GERI), SCRI held its annual GET workshop for GERI and other healthcare institutions such as Changi General Hospital and Woodlands Health Campus. The workshop attracted a diverse audience including clinician-scientists, biostatisticians, clinical research coordinators (CRCs) and research officers.</p><h4></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2023/2023_05_25_GERI_GET_1_isomer.jpg"></div><h4><br><strong><u>Crafting an engaging and robust grant proposal</u></strong></h4><p>&nbsp;A/Prof Edwin Chan, Chief Scientific Officer, and A/Prof Mihir Gandhi, Head of Biostatistics, led the first session by sharing valuable insights into the key elements of a grant application, along with practical tips for crafting concise and compelling research proposals that would persuade funders.</p><p>&nbsp;The knowledge shared was valuable to the participants, as their proposals contribute to multidisciplinary research that may translate into tangible solutions for our healthcare system. GERI, in particular, focuses on research in health and healthcare related to ageing, so as to impact health policy and practice and improve the lives of seniors in Singapore.</p><p>A/Prof Edwin emphasised the need for proposals to possess a logical flow. He drew upon his experience, sharing how his Ph.D. supervisor likened the process of writing papers to "weaving a story" that engages reviewers. A simple linking sentence was highlighted as an effective tool to connect different sections of the proposal, ensuring a concise and coherent narrative. The avoidance of excessive technical jargon was also stressed, enabling reviewers to understand the proposal, even if they lack expertise in the specific field.</p>

<p>Submitting grant proposals can be an arduous process for some. To better
equip principal investigators (PIs) and research officers with the skills
to navigate this challenge, SCRI organises Grant Enhancement Training (GET)
workshops every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;On 18 and 25 May 2023, in partnership with the Geriatric Education
&amp; Research Institute (GERI), SCRI held its annual GET workshop for
GERI and other healthcare institutions such as Changi General Hospital
and Woodlands Health Campus. The workshop attracted a diverse audience
including clinician-scientists, biostatisticians, clinical research coordinators
(CRCs) and research officers.</p>

<h4><br><strong><u>Crafting an engaging and robust grant proposal</u></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;A/Prof Edwin Chan, Chief Scientific Officer, and A/Prof Mihir Gandhi,
Head of Biostatistics, led the first session by sharing valuable insights
into the key elements of a grant application, along with practical tips
for crafting concise and compelling research proposals that would persuade
funders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The knowledge shared was valuable to the participants, as their
proposals contribute to multidisciplinary research that may translate into
tangible solutions for our healthcare system. GERI, in particular, focuses
on research in health and healthcare related to ageing, so as to impact
health policy and practice and improve the lives of seniors in Singapore.</p>
<p>A/Prof Edwin emphasised the need for proposals to possess a logical flow.
He drew upon his experience, sharing how his Ph.D. supervisor likened the
process of writing papers to "weaving a story" that engages reviewers.
A simple linking sentence was highlighted as an effective tool to connect
different sections of the proposal, ensuring a concise and coherent narrative.
The avoidance of excessive technical jargon was also stressed, enabling
reviewers to understand the proposal, even if they lack expertise in the
specific field.</p>

</div>
<p>Furthermore, A/Prof Edwin spoke about the significance of conducting a
systematic literature review to bolster the case for the proposal's importance.
By examining key studies and identifying gaps in current management options,
applicants can demonstrate the relevance and necessity of their research
within the local context. This approach not only enhances the team’s credibility
but also emphasises the potential impact of their proposal.</p>
<p>A/Prof Gandhi addressed common pitfalls encountered by new PIs in their
proposals. He highlighted the importance of feasibility, a reasonable budget,
proper sample size justification, and a robust statistical analytical plan.</p>

</div>
<p>To ensure data quality and minimise staff fatigue, he recommended planning
for a study without excessive and unnecessary data points. Additionally,
A/Prof Gandhi underscored the importance of describing study design, endpoint
selection and other methodologies from the outset, reducing the need for
assumptions by reviewers throughout the proposal. Lastly, he emphasised
the need for collaboration with a statistician to write the methodology
section of the grant proposal, ensuring that planned endpoints are well-supported
by data and aligned with the study's specific objectives.</p>
<p>During the Q&amp;A session, participants sought advice on optimal sample
sizes for the planned objectives, as well as strategies for conducting
preliminary studies due to resource constraints.</p>

</div>
<p>In their concluding remarks, both A/Prof Edwin and A/Prof Gandhi reiterated
the importance of seeking input from peers outside their specific fields
of expertise. Having a neutral perspective can identify areas that require
further clarity or improvement, enabling applicants to refine their proposals
and make them more comprehensible.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Strategies for effective data management and study operations</u></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Ms Ng Xuanhui, Head of Data Management, Dr Cynthia Cao, Senior Project
Manager and Dr Edward Tan, Lead, Research Administration (Support), GERI,
led the second session.</p>
<p>Xuanhui provided valuable guidance on data management for teams without
a dedicated data manager. She outlined a six-step process, starting with
developing a study plan to identify operational challenges and ensure data
collected is relevant to objectives set for the study. Data cleaning was
emphasised to maintain validity and consistency, especially when verifying
data against assessment results.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>She further stressed on having a robust centralised system for data integration.
Alternatively, participants were advised to reconcile data from different
sources to ensure comprehensive information. The BEST acronym (Baseline,
Efficacy, Safety, Treatment and termination) was suggested as a framework
for evaluating endpoints. Finally, Xuanhui highlighted the use of standardised
data entry formats to facilitate efficient data cleaning and analysis.</p>
<p>She also introduced a data management plan which serves as a guiding template
for all involved, including research coordinators and IT teams. It provides
a roadmap for data handling, practical steps to address challenges and
can even be used for audit purposes to document the study's execution.</p>
<p>Dr Cao provided insights into five key aspects of study operations: project
organisation structure, stakeholder management, high-level risks, milestones
and timelines, and the inclusion of research services in the budget. She
emphasised the importance of establishing a clear project organisation
structure and engaging key stakeholders from the beginning to prevent oversights
and delays. She provided an example where a missing test due to lack of
stakeholder involvement caused significant delays in a multicentre study.
Managing stakeholder expectations and actively involving them throughout
the study process were highlighted as crucial for success.</p>

</div>
<p>Identifying high-level risks and implementing a risk management mitigation
plan were recommended to address potential challenges. Tracking key milestones
and timelines allows for timely decision-making and addressing delays.
In addition, budget planning should consider including research services
to ensure professional support, especially when collaborating with external
parties.</p>
<p>Dr Cao concluded by sharing SCRI’s complimentary Pre-Grant Operation Support
for public healthcare researchers, offering reviews of study operations
in grant proposals, provision of study checklists, and consultation services
on the management of the study operation. This support aims to assist researchers,
particularly new PIs, in enhancing their study operation management and
revising grant applications effectively.</p>

</div>
<p>Dr Tan led a session on budgeting for research projects, where he shared
some of the broad pointers and considerations when planning and managing
project budgets. He reiterated the significance of understanding the funder’s
specific requirements when creating project budgets. Referring to the terms
and conditions for purchases is essential as different agencies may have
different requirements for allowable expenses. It is crucial to align the
proposed budget with the narrative in the proposal, while being concrete
and specific in budget requests. When asked about budgeting for extensions,
he emphasised the need to work closely with one’s institutional administration
as practices may differ across institutions.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Through this workshop, the collective insights provided by SCRI and GERI
staff will serve as valuable resources for participants as they strive
to stand out in a competitive environment. By establishing clear connections
between their objectives and the collected data, while avoiding unnecessary
repetition, they can effectively communicate their research ideas to reviewers.&nbsp;
With newly gained strategies for effective data management, participants
can better structure their data operations and enhance their research endeavours.</p>

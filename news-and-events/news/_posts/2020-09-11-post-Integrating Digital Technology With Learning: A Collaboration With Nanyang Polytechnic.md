<p><strong>Programme Duration:</strong> 04 September 2020 to 20 November 2020</p><p><strong>Venue:</strong> Zoom (Online)</p><p><strong>Organiser:</strong> SCRI Academy</p><p>In a collaborative effort with Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP), the SCRI Academy launched its second virtual class for CRCs and research personnel participants under the 12-week Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) Level 1 Programme (Blended).</p><p><br>Conducted on 11 September 2020, the full-day class for the module ‘Essentials in Clinical Practice’ focused on providing participants with key nursing concepts to be applied in the context of a clinical research setting, and served to enhance their role as CRCs. A multitude of collaborative technology tools and resources were incorporated into the curriculum, and facilitated interactive learning for the September 2020 intake, despite having to compromise on the physical hands-on activities offered to previous cohorts.</p><p>To further boost each participant’s learning, game-based learning platforms and videos were introduced to spur meaningful discussions. Participants were also given the opportunity to participate in virtual role-plays with their peers, helping them to reflect and understand from the research subject’s perspective, and develop empathy while applying the learned theories to real-life scenarios they could face in their profession.</p><p>The SCRI Academy would like to extend our gratitude to NYP for supporting the national CRC training programme and for making a seamless transition to a digital learning environment. The high positive ratings received from the lesson is testament to the success of our collaboration, and we look forward to future collaborations to drive continuous learning in the field of clinical research.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2020/2_1024x532.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2020/3__1_.png"></div><p>Participants of the CRC Level 1 Programme engaging in virtual role-plays, helping them to apply the learned content to relevant, real-world contexts.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2020/4.png"></div><p>A snapshot of a video demonstration about the collection of vital signs.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2020/5.png"></div><p>The line-up of CRC Level 1 Programme participants who have successfully completed the NYP Essentials in Clinical Practice module, along with the NYP Lecturer Mr Choo Chang How.</p>

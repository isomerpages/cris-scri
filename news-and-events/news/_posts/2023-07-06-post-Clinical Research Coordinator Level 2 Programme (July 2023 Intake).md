<br><strong>Programme Duration:</strong>&nbsp;06 July 2023 to 21 July 2023</p>
<p><strong>Venue:</strong>&nbsp;NTU@one-north</p>
<p><strong>Organiser:</strong>&nbsp;SCRI Academy</p>
<p>The CRC Level 2 Programme is run once a year every July. This year, SCRI
was thrilled to welcome 36 participants for the third run of the programme
since it was launched in 2021. The class size for this run saw a whopping
increase from the usual 20 participants thanks to overwhelming response
in registrations and positive reviews from past participants from both
hospitals and polyclinics at the public healthcare clusters.</p>
<p>This programme is designed to equip CRCs with at least two years of experience
in coordinating clinical research studies. The course curriculum is designed
to equip them with essential project management concepts and tools commonly
employed in clinical research studies. Through the six-day programme held
over three weeks, the CRCs acquired the necessary skills to effectively
coordinate investigator-initiated clinical research studies across a wide
range of study designs. To make lessons more engaging, the CRCs honed their
skills through case-studies, group discussions and practice-based activities.</p>
<p>Investigator-initiated trials are led by research clinicians in the public
healthcare setting according to their research interests to provide better
care for their patients. Hence, these researchers, also known as Principal
Investigators (PI) would require the steady support from CRCs in areas
such as drafting the study design and research protocol, preparing the
research site, gaining regulatory approvals, patient recruitment, as well
as monitoring the progress of the research study.</p>

<p>Dr Yeo Jing Ping shared on the overview of regulatory framework in Singapore.
She also emphasised on IRB submission requirement and the types of research
that require IRB review.</p>
<p>Ms Michelle Ho offered valuable perspectives on establishing a Quality
Management System (QMS) within the context of clinical research. In addition,
she highlighted the importance of detecting root causes of deviations /
non-compliance and rectifying them with appropriate corrective and preventive
actions.</p>
<p>Ms Stacey Low provided the participants with guidance on how to be inspection-ready
and covered what they should anticipate before, during and after the inspection
by auditors.</p>
<p>Ms Ivy Cruz Dimarucut discussed the different types of legal agreements
employed in clinical trial protocols to protect both clinical trial participants
and researchers. She explained the process of conducting an agreement review
and also highlighted the significance of insurance in clinical trials.</p>

<p>When asked what was their personal takeaway from the course, one attendee
said: “The programme benefited me a lot. It refreshed my memory on important
good practices to apply in my daily work and deepened my knowledge on the
various aspects of coordinating clinical trials,”</p>
<p>“I have gained more knowledge on juggling various aspects of a clinical
study and keeping everything in order,” another attendee added.</p>
<p>“I learned a lot about the different aspects of managing a clinical trial,
especially from a non-CRC perspective, such as from a Project Manager point
of view,” shared another attendee.&nbsp;</p>

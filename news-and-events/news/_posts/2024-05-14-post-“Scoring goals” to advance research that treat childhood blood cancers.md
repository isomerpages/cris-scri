<p>Solid, dependable, and consistent – these are the quality traits Germaine
Liew takes on as the “defender” on the futsal court, a sport she enjoys
as a hobby.</p>
<p>Germaine, who manages to schedule some time on the court whenever she
can, has been actively involved in football and various team sports since
her school days. She applies these qualities in her job, where over the
past 14 years, she has led clinical research in a range of childhood cancers,
from leukaemia to meningioma (also known as brain tumours).</p>
<p>When Germaine graduated from university in 2009, she served as a Data
Manager for the Childhood Cancer Registry, where she learnt about different
childhood cancers. The early exposure laid the groundwork for her eventual
role as a Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), where she manages several
novel and cutting-edge clinical research studies at KKH’s Children’s Blood
and Cancer Centre.</p>

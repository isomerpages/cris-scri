<p>Solid, dependable, and consistent – these are the quality traits that
Germaine Liew takes on as the “defender” on the futsal court, a sport she
enjoys as a hobby.</p>
<p>Germaine, who manages to schedule some time on the court whenever she
can, has been actively involved in football and various team sports since
her school days. She applies these qualities in her job, where over the
past 14 years, she has led clinical research in a range of childhood cancers,
from leukaemia to brain tumours.</p>
<p>When Germaine graduated from university in 2009, she served as a Data
Manager for the Childhood Cancer Registry, where she learnt about different
childhood cancers. The early exposure laid the groundwork for her eventual
role as a Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), where she manages several
novel and cutting-edge clinical research studies at KKH’s Children’s Blood
and Cancer Centre.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Being a CRC was not a widely-recognised role in the Biomedical industry
at the time. However, while I was serving at the registry, I discovered
that there is so much in clinical research I could contribute to,” she
explained.</p>
<p></p>

<p><em>Germaine Liew, a CRC of 14 years</em>
</p>
<p>Drawing a parallel to her role of “defender” on the futsal field, she
likens a CRC as one who safeguards team goals and makes critical decisions
to direct the team’s strategies, benefiting both the patients she serves
and the studies she oversees.</p>
<p>She extends these same values to her work, where she specialises in coordinating
research trials for children with blood cancers, particularly acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia (ALL). The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468124520300127" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MASPORE ALL2003</a> trial
marked a pivotal moment in her career. The trial utilised a single polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based minimal residual disease marker to stratify
patients according to their risk profile and disease severity as a key
consideration as part of the treatment plan. For patients assessed to be
non-high-risk, a three-drug induction regimen was prescribed for these
patients. The effort led to an improvement in six-year event-free survival
at 80%, with an overall survival of 88%. The study showed that treatment
could be appropriately tailored to disease risk, and that an anthracycline-free
induction strategy did not compromise outcome for the majority of patients.
The study also led to a follow-up trial MASPORE ALL 2010 to optimise the
treatment plan for patients in the high-risk group.</p>
<p>“Back then, I was still learning the ropes. It wasn’t until we concluded
the study and analysed the data that I saw how our patient survivor outcomes
have also steadily improved thanks to the advancements in our local medical
landscape,” she said. For the then young CRC, being part of this study
and witnessing its impact on patient survival outcomes, she felt the similar
sense of satisfaction, akin to scoring her first goal in her career.</p>

</p>
<p>As the study progressed to the next phase (now named MASPORE ALL 2020),
it has become the longest running study that Germaine has managed since
the beginning of her career (the study began in 2003; 21 years). In MASPORE
ALL 2020, precision medicine and risk-adapted therapy remains the cornerstone
strategy for treating this childhood cancer.</p>
<p>She reflected, “I hope that current medical advancements will continue
to challenge the perception that cancer is difficult to cure in young patients.”</p>
<h4><strong>Empowering teams to run effective CAR-T therapy trials</strong></h4>
<p>In recent years, Germaine has also supported Principal Investigators in
leading a new type of revolutionary treatment that has shown to be highly
effective for blood cancers - chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T)
therapy trials.</p>
<p>She adeptly handles tasks such as drafting contract agreements, overseeing
logistics, liaising with manufacturing sites and communicating with clinicians
across various institutions. Her work also involved ensuring compliance
with ethical and regulatory requirements and organising extensive training
sessions for her team to navigate the new treatment modality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When asked how she manages to keep everything in-check and running smoothly,
she shared, “There is a lot of trust within the team — everyone does the
heavy lifting according to their area of expertise. The dedication of the
doctors and nurses who have their own responsibilities but still devote
their time to saving lives serves as a major inspiration for me to keep
going as well,” Germaine said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She shared that hard work and the team effort is especially worthwhile
when <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/new-treatment-saves-toddler-with-aggressive-leukaemia-after-chemotherapy-failed-to-work" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">young patients who have gained access to CAR-T treatments through local clinical trials</a> can
overcome their condition, thrive and are given a second chance at life.</p>
<h4><strong>Bridging gaps and building trust</strong></h4>
<p>For young cancer patients who have exhausted traditional methods of treatment,
they may be considered for CAR-T treatment through the trials. Before enrolling
them, informed consent is required and that is when Germaine steps in to
speak with these patients ranging from newborns to teenagers, as well as
their families. She maintains empathy and compassion by putting herself
in their shoes, and carefully explains the details of the clinical research
study to them.</p>
<p>Germaine is a reassuring presence and valuable member of the healthcare
team, supporting parents, clinicians, and social workers to connect better
with one another. Recognising the isolation that some families may feel,
Germaine goes beyond her call of duty to ensure all are present in these
sessions.</p>
<p>“When a child is diagnosed with cancer, parents become key decision-makers,
despite often feeling overwhelmed and helpless themselves,” she shared.</p>
<p>Although the lead doctors are the ones to explain the studies to the parents,
Germaine makes a conscious effort to be present in those meetings from
start to end such that she is not perceived as someone who “appears abruptly
just to seek consent”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, she explores ways to go beyond her role, such as being a comforting
pillar of support for patients and their family, and deepening the trust
and rapport between the parents and clinicians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“It can be an isolating journey for families. It is crucial that we do
more than just answer their questions; offering them reassurance is equally
important,” she shared.</p>
<p>“This approach is a comforting reminder that the medical team walks with
families on the challenging path, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the
well-being of their child,” she added.</p>
<p>When asked what advice she would give to junior CRCs, Germaine emphasises
that apart from extending empathy to patients, it is important for them
to remain adaptable, learn from mistakes and make timely improvements.</p>

</p>
<p>Much like in futsal, she encourages her mentees to stay agile, anticipate
unforeseen developments and be reliable team players on whom clinicians
and nurses can depend. This approach helps ensure that they effectively
protect the team's objectives and achieve the best outcomes for their patients.</p>

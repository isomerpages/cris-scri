Wonder Woman?</p><p>These are just some of the characters picked by the attendees of the Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) Level 2 Programme when asked which animated characters they felt best represented their work.&nbsp;</p><p>The attendees shared during the laughter-filled ice-breaking session that they often have to multi-task, are expected to soak up information like a sponge, and persevere through challenges when coordinating clinical trials.&nbsp;</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2022/01_1024x557.png"></div><p>Held virtually from 14 to 29 July 2022, the Level 2 course was attended by some 20 CRCs from the public healthcare clusters. This year, the programme also saw returning graduates from the Level 1 course, as well as past recipients of the <a href="https://www.scri.edu.sg/nine-clinical-research-coordinators-recognised-with-distinguished-contributor-award/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Distinguished Contributor Award for CRCs</a>.&nbsp;</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2022/02_1024x652.png"></div><p><em>Winners for one of the Kahoot! classroom game activity which tests attendees' knowledge on the responsibilities of a Sponsor Investigator.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Over six days, attendees honed their project management skills by learning how to coordinate investigator-initiated clinical research studies across a wide range of study designs. They also learnt from one another through the sharing of work experiences and best practices from their respective institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trainers from SCRI Academy also discussed the soft skills and shared tips on how they can better support their investigators as CRCs.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2022/03_1024x664.png"></div><p>When asked what they enjoyed most about the course, one attendee said: “The project management segment was new to me and I really appreciated the opportunity to learn how to better manage multi-site investigator-initiated studies.”</p><p>“It was very helpful to come together with CRCs across the country to share experiences.

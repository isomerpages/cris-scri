<p>An experienced Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), Agnes Teo, Senior
Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) has been serving in the Department
of Women’s Anaesthesia at KK Women's and Children’s Hospital (KKH) for
14 years. Prior to that, she was a CRC in the KK Research Centre for three
years.</p>

<p><em>Agnes Teo, a CRC of 17 years</em>
</p>
<p>She has led numerous clinical trials and introduced medtech innovations
into clinical practice, such as <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/kkh-taps-ai-to-better-deliver-spinal-anaesthesia-to-women-giving-birth-via-caesarean-section" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered ultrasound guided automated spinal landmark identification system, uSINE<sup>®</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Spinal anaesthesia is widely used for pain relief for women in labour.
However, identifying the precise site for needle insertion is a manual
process, and higher accuracy is required. To minimise pain and complications
for patients, uSINE<sup>®</sup> was developed to help doctors to better
deliver spinal anaesthesia at the first attempt.</p>
<p>A mother of two herself, Agnes marvels at the potential of harnessing
technology to elevate patient care, especially in critical moments during
childbirth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My passion for clinical research has been a driving force throughout
my career. It is fulfilling to be actively involved in research studies
that translate to a direct and positive impact for patients, such as safer
or less anxious deliveries for women during childbirth,” she shared.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>Introducing new technologies into clinical practice to elevate patient care during childbirth</strong></h4>
<p>The journey from developing an innovative idea into a product which can
be commercialised and adopted into clinical practice requires determination
and patience to problem-solve and find solutions at each step of the way.</p>
<p>Agnes shared that introducing uSINE<sup>®</sup> into clinical practice
took three years. As lead CRC, Agnes supported the lead Principal Investigator
(PI) in the project, where the team conducted a clinical study that evaluated
the safety and efficacy of uSINE<sup>®</sup> to be adopted into clinical
workflow and practice.</p>

<p><em>Agnes with the uSINE<sup>®</sup> system</em>
</p>
<p>Agnes played a crucial role in managing the intricacies of study operations
and administration. She worked closely with the software developers of
uSINE<sup>®</sup>, conducted user testing with clinicians, and prepared
training materials as the software and device underwent multiple versions
based on user-experience feedback.</p>
<p>When the team encountered challenges in recruiting prospective mothers,
largely due to hesitancy stemming from concerns about their baby's safety,
Agnes drew on her personal experience to allay their fears.</p>
<p>“As most mothers are concerned about the potential side effects, I will
first introduce myself to my patients and go through the study with them
thoroughly. Sharing my experience of having received spinal anaesthesia
the traditional way; it helps them understand the difference and benefits
of using uSINE<sup>®</sup>,” she said.</p>
<p>In addition to patient recruitment, there was the challenge of encouraging
clinicians who were accustomed to the manual method of identifying where
to place the spinal needle in the patient’s lumbar spine, to become more
willing to adopt uSINE<sup>®</sup>.</p>
<p>Determined to showcase the benefits of the technology, Agnes and her team
conducted numerous user tests, gathered diverse feedback from healthcare
professionals, and worked closely with software developers to improve user
experience. Their efforts eventually received positive responses from doctors,
who found the software user-friendly and greatly beneficial.</p>

<p><em>Some of the KKH staff and HiCura Medical team members behind uSINE</em><strong><em><sup>® </sup></em></strong><em>(From L to R): Dr Jason Chan, KKH, Mr Alex Goh and Dr Ng Cailin, HiCura Medical, Ms Agnes Teo, KKH, Mr Joshua Chen, HiCura Medical and A/Prof Sng Ban Leong, KKH.</em>
</p>
<p><em>The system was licensed to HiCura Medical for commercialisation.</em>
</p>
<p>It was a fulfilling moment when the team’s hard work contributed uSINE<strong><sup>®</sup></strong> securing
the approval from the Health Sciences Authority for use in Singapore.</p>
<p>uSINE<strong><sup>®</sup></strong> was implemented in KKH in May 2023.
The success rate for achieving spinal anaesthesia at the first attempt
were revealed in clinical trials:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Women with high body mass index (&gt;30kg/m2): 43% to 82% in obese women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women with normal body mass index (&lt;30kg/m2): 70% to 92%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Comforting mothers through music</strong></h4>
<p>Another memorable project Agnes recalled over her career, was being part
of a team to develop a <a href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/women/c-section-music-therapy-kkh-healing-tunes-356906" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">music-based intervention programme, 'Healing Tunes'</a><u>,</u> and
witness its integration into clinical practice at KKH.</p>
<p>'Healing Tunes', the first such programme in Singapore, aims to reduce
anxiety and minimise pain magnification for women undergoing elective C-sections.
Using a mobile device, patients could select and listen to their preferred
tunes before, during and after surgery,” she shared.</p>
<p>'Healing Tunes' is backed by evidence. In a comprehensive study involving
108 women undergoing elective C-sections, those who underwent the programme
experienced a significant 50% reduction in their anxiety scores, and their
pain magnification scores decreased by 35%.</p>
<h4><strong>Reflecting on her journey in contributing towards safer childbirth experiences for mothers</strong></h4>
<p>Driven by a passion to bring medtech innovations and new technologies
into clinical practice, Agnes shared that such successful new methodologies
would contribute to safer and less anxious child delivery experiences for
mothers in future.</p>
<p>There were many complexities in obtaining regulatory approvals for new
technologies which involves not only understanding the technical aspects
of the devices but also effectively managing the safety and maintenance
processes. Despite the challenges, Agnes persevered, motivated by the dedication
of her team.</p>
<p>Agnes attributes her relentless passion and perseverance to her team of
CRCs, clinicians, and senior research fellows, some of whom she been colleagues
with Agnes since she started working in the department.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They are like my second family,” Agnes said with conviction. Together,
this team continues to strive at improving the maternity care experience
for mothers in Singapore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Outside of work, Agnes prioritises spending quality time with her children
through outdoor activities and sing-along sessions.</p>
<p>“As much as childbirth and parenthood is a learning journey that can be
exhausting at times, at the end of the day, it is worth it when we as mothers
are able to watch our children grow up,” she shared. Agnes finds joy in
her daughter’s love for performing which she finds adorable and whose antics
makes her laugh. On weary days, significant moments such as these reminds
her of her calling to do her job well and ensure that the patients and
mothers-to-be feel safe, heard and cared for — a full circle moment for
her.</p>
<p>Agnes finds a unique sense of achievement when her children excitedly
spot her work in news reports. Looking ahead, Agnes continues to lead new
trials that will improve the patient’s experience, ranging from antenatal
to postnatal care.</p>

<p>In today’s fast-paced world of clinical research, where new studies emerge
daily, a systematic review serves as a vital tool for making sense of it
all.</p>
<p>More than just a method for gathering data, a systematic review offers
a rigorous and structured approach to synthesising research evidence on
a specific topic or question. By adhering to predefined protocol—with clearly
defined criteria for study selection, comprehensive search strategies to
identify all relevant research, and standardised quality assessments—it
ensures that only the most relevant and credible research is considered.</p>
<p>The strength of a systematic review lies in its ability to minimise bias
and provide a transparent, reproducible summary of the evidence. This meticulous
process provides a roadmap for the collection and evaluation of data into
actionable insights that can inform policy, refine clinical practice, and
guide further research.</p>
<p>Cochrane is a global organisation that produces trusted, evidence-based
reviews on healthcare interventions. Founded in 1993, it is renowned for
its rigorous systematic reviews, which has helped guide healthcare decisions
for policymakers, practitioners, and patients worldwide.</p>
<p>In an era driven by evidence-based research, systematic reviews have become
an indispensable part of advancing healthcare and science.</p>
<p>In July 2024, the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) Health
Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) team and National University Singapore
(NUS) co-organised two virtual workshops, ‘Basic Systematic Review and
Meta-Analysis’ and ‘Introduction to Network Meta-Analysis’, designed to
impart the knowledge and principles of Cochrane Review. Both workshops
were led by trainers from the SCRI HEOR team, who are also representatives
of Cochrane Singapore.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Basic Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Workshop brought together
45 participants from private public healthcare institutes, academic and
research organisations. Over the course of five half-days, the workshop
featured a blend of lectures and hands-on sessions, providing attendees
with the core skills and methodologies required to conduct high-quality
systematic reviews.</p>
<p>Participants were introduced to the principles of systematic reviews,
from formulating research questions and conducting comprehensive literature
searches to assessing risk of bias and extracting data. The workshop also
covered advanced topics such as meta-analysis techniques,</p>

<p>A/Prof Edwin Chan, Chief Scientific Officer of SCRI and Director of Cochrane
Singapore, shared about the functionalities of the Cochrane Risk of Bias
(Rob) 2.0 tool, the recommended method for assessing bias in randomised
trials included in Cochrane Reviews.</p>
<p>Our trainers utilised a combination of theory-based lectures and hands-on
sessions, delivering a comprehensive and engaging learning experience.
Key topics were introduced through the lectures that laid a strong theoretical
foundation, covering crucial concepts such as risk of bias assessment,
data extraction, and the creation of Summary of Findings tables.</p>
<p>These lectures were complemented by practical, hands-on sessions where
participants had the opportunity to actively apply these principles. Guided
by our trainers, they worked on paper exercises and utilised specialised
software, translating theory into practice. This blended approach ensured
that participants walked away with a deeper understanding of systematic
reviews and gained practical skills in conducting them effectively in their
own work.</p>

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Building on the foundational principles of systematic reviews and meta-analyses,
network meta-analysis (NMA) is an advanced methodological approach that
enhances the ability to compare multiple healthcare interventions simultaneously.</p>
<p>While traditional meta-analyses focus on direct comparisons between two
interventions, NMA extends this capability by allowing for the comparison
of several treatments within a single analysis, even in the absence of
direct head-to-head trial data.</p>
<p>By synthesising both direct and indirect evidence across a network of
studies, NMA offers a broader and more nuanced understanding of the relative
effectiveness of various interventions. The ‘Introduction to Network Meta-Analysis
Workshop’ was a dynamic and informative event that brought together local
and global researchers and healthcare professionals to deepen their understanding
of advanced evidence synthesis techniques. The five half-day workshop was
joined by 20 participants, including several who had attended the Basic
workshop.</p>
<p>Our trainers delved into the complexities of NMA, covering topics such
as statistical models, assumptions, and the interpretation of results.
The sessions focused on practical application, with participants engaging
in interactive hands-on sessions that involved constructing networks, running
analyses, and interpreting the outputs.</p>
<p>The course also spotlighted commonly used software tools in NMA, ensuring
participants gained both a strong theoretical foundation and the technical
expertise to implement NMAs in their own work.</p>
<p>In previous years, Stata had been the statistical software taught in practical
sessions. This year’s workshop featured an additional half-day dedicated
to hands-on sessions to familiarise with a new statistical software – RStudio,
an open-source tool that offers an alternative to participants.</p>
<p>Participants practised conducting NMA for different data outcomes using
Stata and RStudio, respectively. They were also introduced to MetaInsight,
a web app designed to allow users to upload data and obtain the NMA results
instantly, adding another layer of practical, real-time learning to the
experience</p>

<p>SCRI HEOR trainers sharing concepts and guiding participants during the
theory-based and practical sessions.</p>
<p>The workshop concluded on a high note with in-depth sessions on the Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and Confidence
in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approaches for assessing the certainty
of evidence, and the standards for reporting NMA results.</p>
<p>With an emphasis on the importance of evaluating the certainty of evidence,
the final sessions guided participants through the assessment of key factors
such as publication bias, indirectness, risk of bias, inconsistency, and
imprecision. The concluding discussions spotlighted best practices for
reporting NMA results with transparency, ensuring that the conclusions
drawn are robust and reliable. By the end of the workshop, participants
were equipped with a thorough understanding of how to effectively communicate
NMA findings, enhancing the impact of their work on evidence-based healthcare.</p>
<p>The NMA technique has become valuable in complex scenarios where clinicians
and principal investigators need to evaluate numerous therapeutic options.
With our data-driven healthcare system today, being equipped with these
advanced techniques is crucial to stay at the cutting-edge of evidence-based
practice and research.</p>

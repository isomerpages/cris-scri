<p>In today’s fast-paced world of clinical research, where new studies emerge
daily, a systematic review serves as a vital tool for making sense of it
all.</p>
<p>More than just a method for gathering data, a systematic review offers
a rigorous and structured approach to synthesising research evidence on
a specific topic or question. By adhering to predefined protocol—with clearly
defined criteria for study selection, comprehensive search strategies to
identify all relevant research, and standardised quality assessments—it
ensures that only the most relevant and credible research is considered.</p>
<p>The strength of a systematic review lies in its ability to minimise bias
and provide a transparent, reproducible summary of the evidence. This meticulous
process provides a roadmap for the collection and evaluation of data into
actionable insights that can inform policy, refine clinical practice, and
guide further research.</p>
<p>Cochrane is a global organisation that produces trusted, evidence-based
reviews on healthcare interventions. Founded in 1993, it is renowned for
its rigorous systematic reviews, which has helped guide healthcare decisions
for policymakers, practitioners, and patients worldwide.</p>
<p>In an era driven by evidence-based research, systematic reviews have become
an indispensable part of advancing healthcare and science.</p>
<p>In July 2024, the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) Health
Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) team and National University Singapore
(NUS) co-organised two virtual workshops, ‘Basic Systematic Review and
Meta-Analysis’ and ‘Introduction to Network Meta-Analysis’, designed to
impart the knowledge and principles of Cochrane Review. Both workshops
were led by trainers from the SCRI HEOR team, who are also representatives
of Cochrane Singapore.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Basic Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Workshop brought together
45 participants from private public healthcare institutes, academic and
research organisations. Over the course of five half-days, the workshop
featured a blend of lectures and hands-on sessions, providing attendees
with the core skills and methodologies required to conduct high-quality
systematic reviews.</p>
<p>
<br>Participants were introduced to the principles of systematic reviews,
from formulating research questions and conducting comprehensive literature
searches to assessing risk of bias and extracting data. The workshop also
covered advanced topics such as meta-analysis techniques,</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>interpreting findings, and the importance of maintaining transparency
and reproducibility in research.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SCRI HEOR trainers shared a step-by-step guide on conducting a Cochrane
Systematic Review and formulating a structured question using the PICO
framework.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A/Prof Edwin Chan, Chief Scientific Officer of SCRI and Director of Cochrane
Singapore, shared about the functionalities of the Cochrane Risk of Bias
(Rob) 2.0 tool, the recommended method for assessing bias in randomised
trials included in Cochrane Reviews.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our trainers utilised a combination of theory-based lectures and hands-on
sessions, delivering a comprehensive and engaging learning experience.
Key topics were introduced through the lectures that laid a strong theoretical
foundation, covering crucial concepts such as risk of bias assessment,
data extraction, and the creation of Summary of Findings tables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These lectures were complemented by practical, hands-on sessions where
participants had the opportunity to actively apply these principles. Guided
by our trainers, they worked on paper exercises and utilised specialised
software, translating theory into practice. This blended approach ensured
that participants walked away with a deeper understanding of systematic
reviews and gained practical skills in conducting them effectively in their
own work.</p>

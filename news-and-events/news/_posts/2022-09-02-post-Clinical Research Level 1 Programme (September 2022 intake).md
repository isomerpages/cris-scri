The course received an overwhelming response in registrations and the class size was increased from the usual 30 to 38.</p><p>As the national learning and development platform for CRCs, the increase in sign-ups from across the public healthcare institutions is welcome, as SCRI is committed to develop a well-trained talent pool of CRCs who are the bedrock of the clinical research ecosystem in Singapore. The course attendees, many with less than a year’s experience, journeyed through the 12-week comprehensive programme to learn the basics of coordinating clinical trials, from protocol feasibility to study start-up, ethics and regulation, recruitment and study closure. The CRCs were equipped with fundamental knowledge of the daily operations and duties in coordinating clinical trials through class demonstrations, role-playing sessions and case scenarios.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2022/Pic_sep1_e1671770732996.png"></div><p>Participants shared their answers with one another as Ms Valerie Wee, Senior Executive from the Group Education and Research department, NHG conducted the lesson and shared case scenarios on how to effectively receive informed consent from trial participants.

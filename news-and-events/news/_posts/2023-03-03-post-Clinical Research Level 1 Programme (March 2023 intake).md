After two-and-a-half years of online lessons due to the pandemic, the Level 1 Programme was off to a lively start as laughter and chatter filled the air during the ice-breaker games. &nbsp;</p><p>This entry-level course gives CRCs who are just starting out in their careers a firm head start. With the increasing complexity and demand for clinical research, it is vital that CRCs are equipped with the fundamental skills to ensure the success of clinical trials.<br>A number of the course participants were only a few months into their careers and were keen to learn more about study design, budgeting for sponsored studies, obtaining IRB approvals, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of the role of a CRC.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2023/News_1_1024x686.jpg"></div><p>During the course, two newly minted CRC Educators from our CRC Educator Group programme also shared the skills needed to coordinate clinical trials and support principal investigators.</p><p>CRC Educators are experienced CRCs who are passionate about or keen to explore training and developing the next generation of CRCs. In addition to teaching opportunities, they will be able to receive sponsorships for professional certifications in clinical research or attend conferences to grow their career.</p><p>They spoke about topics such as how to use a study start-up checklist, how to screen and recruit potential participants and the roles and responsibilities within the research team. Attendees also learnt the importance of documentation, which includes performing protocol feasibility assessments, determining if a study site if it is suitable for a study, and arranging for site visits.</p><p>The CRC L1 programme is tailored to provide junior CRCs a comprehensive introduction to run clinical trials or a research study. To ensure that content remains up-to-date and aligned with industry practices, the course curriculum is taught by both SCRI Academy trainers and collaborators from the public healthcare institutions and regulatory authorities.</p><p>For this run of the programme, Dr Ma Libin, Senior Medical Director, Global Medical Affairs and Ms Foo Siew Min, Business Development Lead, Central Laboratory Services from Labcorp Development (Asia) Pte. Ltd., gave insights into industry standards and best practices on specimen collection. They discussed the importance of pack samples properly at-site, and shared useful resources such as step-by-step videos on sample collection and shipping. The speakers also emphasised that CRCs should adhere to the detailed instructions in the lab manual so as to ensure that the upstream efforts of CRCs in recruiting patients and administration of medications would not be in vain.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2023/News_3_1.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2023/News_4.jpg"></div><p><em>Dr Ma Libin and Ms Foo Siew Min sharing their experiences on what to look out for when CRCs receive a collection kit.</em></p><p>Over the seven-week programme, the participants gained a better grasp of how to apply fundamental CRC skills in their daily work.

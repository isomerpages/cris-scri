A big thank you to the clinical research personnel, public healthcare institutions, regulatory authorities and various training partners for their notable support in accommodating the new norm of safe learning. SCRI Academy will continue to build on its strengths and programmes to continue its successful collaborations with training partners and CRCs.</p><p>The 12-week virtual programme consists of classroom demonstrations, role-play and case scenarios that test the participants on the application of core CRC skills in daily operations and duties. The programme encouraged the participants to share their experiences and insights with one another through interactive virtual classrooms activities.</p><p>One example is the Essentials in Clinical Practice module, conducted by Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) lecturer Mr Choo Chan How, which introduced key nursing concepts and drew connections to actual nursing practices that enhanced the participants’ knowledge as CRCs. Attendees also received a certificate from NYP in a mini virtual graduation ceremony.</p><p>“Mr Choo provided a safe environment for learning and helped us to learn from our mistakes in an encouraging way. Although the module was conducted virtually, Mr Choo’s engaging tutoring style made the lessons interactive and enriching for all of us,” one participant commented.</p><p>Congratulations to all graduating CRCs who completed the programme.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2021/Slide6_1024x576.jpg"></div><p>Mini virtual graduation for the NYP module</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2021/Role_play.png"></div><p>CRCs participating in virtual role play on week 6</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2021/Revision_2.png"></div><p>SCRI Academy trainers Mr Eric Seow and Ms Tan Siew Hoon conducting revision for CRCs on week 11</p>

<p><strong>Research Office staff enrich their professional skills at SCRI-CGH Monitoring Workshop</strong>
</p>
<p>SCRI Academy collaborated with Changi General Hospital (CGH) to conduct
a monitoring workshop on 20, 22 and 30 June 2023 for four staff from the
CGH Research Office (RO).</p>
<p>These staff have an average of five years’ experience in coordinating
clinical trials and/or conducting clinical research projects, and the training
in project management skills and a broad range of study designs complemented
their fundamental competencies in supporting investigator-initiated clinical
trials.</p>
<p>Monitoring is an important component in running clinical trials as this
role ensures that studies are in compliance with the approved protocol,
regulatory and Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements and Good Clinical
Practice (GCP).</p>
<p>The Monitor drives the production of quality research data for clinicians.
Some of their responsibilities include source document verification, protocol
and GCP compliance checks, safety, operations and essential document review,
and conducting reviews for investigational products and lab samples.</p>
<p>They also facilitate communication with project stakeholders including
sponsor/ sponsor-investigator and trial sites. These steps are crucial
in ensuring the clinical studies continue to run according to plans and
they can help find solutions for challenges that occur along the way.</p>
<p>The workshop curriculum was developed by SCRI Academy in collaboration
with the SingHealth Office of Research Integrity, Compliance and Ethics
(RICE). Topics covered include the following:</p>
<p>• Roles and responsibilities of the Monitor</p>
<p>• Types of visits conducted by Monitors and their purposes</p>
<p>• Design of study logs and templates</p>
<p>• Understanding the monitoring plan</p>
<p>• How to be well-prepared for a monitoring visit</p>
<p>• How to conduct monitoring and follow up tasks after the visit</p>
<p>The sessions were engaging with scenario discussions and role-play on
conducting a site initiation visit, as well as how to conduct effective
discussions with the site Principal Investigator and the study’s Clinical
Research Coordinator (CRC) during a monitoring visit.</p>
<p>The role-play sessions helped prepare the participants for the real-life
scenarios they may face when conducting monitoring visits. The participants
were also given hands-on practice on how to review the investigator site
file, and went through a real case study to help them better understand
the monitor’s role in verifying compliance and completeness of source documentation.</p>
<p>The workshop concluded with participants submitting their findings in
a written report. The trainers also provided tips on clear report writing
and how to develop practical corrective and preventive actions for the
findings.</p>
<p>SCRI Academy is glad to partner Changi General Hospital on this collaboration,
and we look forward to further opportunities to enhance Singapore’s clinical
research ecosystem.</p>

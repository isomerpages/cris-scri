<p>Congratulations to the nine Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs) who
    received the Distinguished Contributor Award for CRCs for their dedication
    to the profession and outstanding contributions to Singapore’s research
    community.</p>
<p>Held on 24 January 2024, this is the fourth year the award has been presented
    since its launch in 2019, and there were 34 nominations received from the
    public healthcare institutions.</p>
<p>Presented by the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI), the Distinguished
    Contributor Award recognises exceptional clinical research coordinators
    for their commitment, dedication and significant contributions to the profession
    and clinical research community.</p>
<p>CRCs form the bedrock of Singapore’s clinical research ecosystem. They
    are instrumental in not just driving clinical research but more importantly,
    ensuring the quality of the clinical research studies.</p>
<p>The role of a CRC encompasses a multitude of end-to-end responsibilities
    in managing clinical research studies, from protocol development, budgeting
    and ensuring regulatory compliance, to helming participant recruitment
    and tracking quality data management, as well as looking out for patient
    safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>CRCs have the fundamental skills and knowledge to set up and manage complex
    clinical trials. With the right mix of talent and spirit of excellence,
    CRCs help bring science and innovation into our clinics and hospitals to
    achieve better outcomes for our patients.</p>
<p>The nine winners have demonstrated outstanding professional competence
    and leadership in various aspects of clinical research operations and administration,
    and displayed tremendous dedication to their job and passion to empower
    the next generation of CRCs in their team.</p>
<p>The SCRI Academy congratulates all recipients for making a difference
    to the clinical research community.</p>

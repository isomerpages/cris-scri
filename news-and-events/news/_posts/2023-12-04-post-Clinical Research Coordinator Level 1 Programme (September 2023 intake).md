<p><strong>Empowering CRCs with Essential Skills for Effective Clinical Trial Management</strong>
</p>
<p>Clinical research coordinators (CRC) play a pivotal role in running clinical
trials, managing various responsibilities daily to ensure the smooth progress
of the clinical research study. Their duties encompass a wide range of
tasks, including participant recruitment and screening, and at times, even
being an advocate for the participant.</p>
<p>CRCs are required to collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, ensure
adherence to study protocols, ethical guidelines, and regulatory requirements.
For junior CRCs, the learning curve can be steep in their early career.</p>
<p>Since 2018, SCRI Academy has been conducting the CRC Level 1 Programme
for junior CRCs with less than a year of experience in conducting clinical
trials to support their career development in this profession.</p>
<p>This Level 1 programme, which is run every March and September, aims to
support CRCs in navigating the complexities of clinical trial management
and to equip them with vital skills for the efficient running and administration
of clinical trials.</p>
<p>This course provides a strong foundation for CRCs to learn the ropes on
how to effectively carry out the above duties mentioned, as well as gauge
protocol feasibility, draw up study budgets, conduct safety reporting to
site closure.</p>
<p>To-date, over 280 junior CRCs have been trained and SCRI Academy welcomed
another 30 junior CRCs to the 11th cohort of CRC Level 1 Programme in September
2023.</p>

</div>
<p>To make lessons engaging and relevant for the newly minted CRCs, interactive
in-class games and role play was introduced to aid learning and recall.</p>
<p>SCRI Academy extends our heartfelt gratitude to training partners from
the Clinical Research industry who have come alongside to nurture the next
generation of clinical research professionals. In this run, our partner
from Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of Health and Social Sciences provided
an in-depth sharing on the Essentials in Clinical Practice, offering a
comprehensive overview of Singapore’s healthcare system.</p>
<p>They also taught the CRCs valuable skills such as how to use a blood pressure
monitor. This skill is essential as monitoring blood pressure is a standard
practice used to assess cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>In some research studies, taking blood pressure readings may be essential
to the study protocol or done as a baseline assessment. Being able to monitor
blood pressure is also one aspect of safety monitoring. For example, blood
pressure monitoring is one way to assess cardiovascular health or identify
potential adverse effects related to certain investigational products or
treatment therapies being administered in a research study.</p>
<p>We were also glad to have four senior CRCs from the CRC Educator Group
to conduct some of these sessions and share about their own experiences
to inspire the CRCs who are just starting out in this career.</p>
<p>This special CRC Educator Group was launched by SCRI Academy in 2022 with
the aim to provide teaching opportunities for senior CRCs who are passionate
about sharing their knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>The CRC Educators introduced the roles and responsibilities of a research
team and brought the course participants through the entire process and
each stage of a clinical trial.</p>
<p>It was an eye-opening and practical session which did not shy away from
challenges that CRCs will likely encounter in their first few years on
the job. This includes ensuring compliance with regulatory guidelines for
clinical research, understanding the intricacies of research protocols,
identifying suitable participants for a clinical research study, and cultivating
communication skills to avoid misunderstandings, so as to facilitate smooth
collaborations between the many groups that CRCs have to meet daily. These
could range from the study’s Principal Investigator and the study site
representative to the study sponsor and study participants.</p>
<p>The CRC Educators came prepared with many useful case studies from their
years of experience and facilitated lively discussions with the course
participants. Next, they brainstormed ways to find solutions and list down
preventive measures.</p>

<p>Participants gained valuable insights from the trainers and exchanged
stories with one another.</p>
<p>Over seven weeks, through the weekly group interactions and engaging sessions,
the CRCs enjoyed many fun and authentic interactions, where laughter filled
the air and firm friendships were formed.</p>

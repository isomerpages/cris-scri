<p>An experienced Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), Agnes Teo, Senior
Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) has been serving in KKH’s Women’s Anaesthesia
department for 14 years. She has led numerous clinical trials and introduced
medtech innovations into clinical practice, such as <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/kkh-taps-ai-to-better-deliver-spinal-anaesthesia-to-women-giving-birth-via-caesarean-section" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered ultrasound guided automated spinal landmark identification system, uSINE<sup>®</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Spinal anaesthesia is widely used for pain relief for women in labour.
However, identifying the precise site for needle insertion is a manual
process, and higher accuracy is required. To minimise pain and complications
for patients, uSINE<sup>®</sup> was developed to help doctors to better
deliver spinal anaesthesia at the first attempt.</p>
<p>A mother of two herself, Agnes marvels at the potential of harnessing
technology to elevate patient care, especially in critical moments during
childbirth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My passion for clinical research has been a driving force throughout
my career. It is fulfilling to be actively involved in research studies
that translate to a direct and positive impact for patients, such as safer
or less anxious deliveries for women during childbirth,” she shared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another memorable project she recalled over her career, was being part
of a team to develop a <a href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/women/c-section-music-therapy-kkh-healing-tunes-356906" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">music-based intervention programme, 'Healing Tunes'</a><u>,</u> and
witness its integration into clinical practice at KKH.</p>
<p>'Healing Tunes', the first such programme in Singapore, aims to reduce
anxiety and minimise pain magnification for women undergoing elective C-sections
in the operating theatres. Using a mobile device, patients could select
and listen to their preferred tunes before, during and after surgery,”
she shared.</p>

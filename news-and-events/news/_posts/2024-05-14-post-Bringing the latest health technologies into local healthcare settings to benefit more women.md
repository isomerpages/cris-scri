<p>An experienced Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), Agnes Teo, Senior
Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) has been serving in KKH’s Women’s Anaesthesia
department for 14 years. She has led numerous clinical trials and introduced
medtech innovations into clinical practice, such as <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/kkh-taps-ai-to-better-deliver-spinal-anaesthesia-to-women-giving-birth-via-caesarean-section" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered ultrasound guided automated spinal landmark identification system, uSINE<sup>®</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Spinal anaesthesia is widely used for pain relief for women in labour.
However, identifying the precise site for needle insertion is a manual
process, and higher accuracy is required. To minimise pain and complications
for patients, uSINE<sup>®</sup> was developed to help doctors to better
deliver spinal anaesthesia at the first attempt.</p>
<p>A mother of two herself, Agnes marvels at the potential of harnessing
technology to elevate patient care, especially in critical moments during
childbirth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My passion for clinical research has been a driving force throughout
my career. It is fulfilling to be actively involved in research studies
that translate to a direct and positive impact for patients, such as safer
or less anxious deliveries for women during childbirth,” she shared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another memorable project she recalled over her career, was being part
of a team to develop a <a href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/women/c-section-music-therapy-kkh-healing-tunes-356906" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">music-based intervention programme, 'Healing Tunes'</a><u>,</u> and
witness its integration into clinical practice at KKH.</p>
<p>'Healing Tunes', the first such programme in Singapore, aims to reduce
anxiety and minimise pain magnification for women undergoing elective C-sections
in the operating theatres. Using a mobile device, patients could select
and listen to their preferred tunes before, during and after surgery,”
she shared.</p>
<p>'Healing Tunes' is backed by evidence. In a comprehensive study involving
108 women undergoing elective C-sections, those who underwent the programme
experienced a significant 50% reduction in their anxiety scores, and their
pain magnification scores decreased by 35%.</p>
<h4><strong>Bringing new technologies from ideation into clinical practice to elevate patient care during childbirth</strong></h4>
<p>The journey from developing innovation through to adoption, commercialisation
and into clinical practice requires determination and patience to problem-solve
and find solutions at each step of the way.</p>
<p>Agnes shared that introducing uSINE<sup>®</sup> into clinical practice
took three years. As lead CRC, Agnes supported the lead Principal Investigator
(PI) in the project, where the team conducted a clinical study that evaluated
the safety and efficacy of uSINE<sup>®</sup> to be adopted into clinical
workflow and practice.</p>
<p>Agnes played a crucial role in managing the intricacies of study operations
and administration. She worked closely with the software developers of
uSINE<sup>®</sup>, engaged in user testing with clinicians, and prepared
training materials as the software and device underwent multiple versions
based on user-experience feedback.</p>
<p>When the team encountered challenges in recruiting prospective mothers,
largely due to hesitancy stemming from concerns about their baby's safety,
Agnes drew on her personal experience to allay their fears.</p>
<p>“As most mothers are concerned about the potential side effects, I will
first introduce myself to my patients and go through the study with them
thoroughly. Sharing my experience of having received spinal anaesthesia
the traditional way; it helps them understand the difference and benefits
of using uSINE<sup>®</sup>,” she said.</p>
<p>In addition to patient recruitment, there was the challenge of encouraging
clinicians who were accustomed to the manual method of identifying where
to place the spinal needle in the patient’s lumbar spine, to become more
willing to use uSINE<sup>®</sup>.</p>
<p>Determined to showcase the benefits of uSINE<sup>®</sup>, Agnes and her
team conducted numerous user tests, gathered diverse feedback from healthcare
professionals, and worked closely with software developers of uSINE<sup>®</sup> to
improve the user experience. Their efforts eventually received positive
responses from doctors, who found the software user-friendly and greatly
beneficial.</p>
<p>PHOTO OF USINE TEAM</p>
<p>It was a fulfilling moment when the team’s hard work contributed to the
successful clinical evaluation of uSINE<strong><sup>®</sup></strong> which
secured approval from the Health Sciences Authority for use in other healthcare
institutions in Singapore.</p>
<p>uSINE<strong><sup>®</sup></strong> was implemented in KKH in May 2023.
The success rate for achieving spinal anaesthesia at the first attempt
using uSINE<strong><sup>®</sup></strong> were revealed in clinical trials:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Women with high body mass index (&gt;30kg/m2): 43% to 82% in obese women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women with normal body mass index (&lt;30kg/m2): 70% to 92%</p>
</li>
</ul>

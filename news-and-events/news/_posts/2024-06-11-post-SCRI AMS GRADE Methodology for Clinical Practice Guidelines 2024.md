<p>In May and June 2024, SCRI, <a href="https://singapore.cochrane.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cochrane Singapore</a>&nbsp;and
the Academy of Medicine, Singapore (AMS) jointly organised a workshop designed
to provide AMS workgroup members and clinicians<s> </s>with the technical
skills and knowledge to develop their own clinical practice guidelines
(CPGs). CPGs are important for patient care, because these frameworks ensure
consistent, evidence-based care to support healthcare professionals in
making informed and effective treatment decisions. The training focused
on effectively utilising the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines methodology to support evidence-based
framework to support clinical decision making.</p>
<p>The workshop consisted of three modules over seven sessions, covering
key aspects such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Introduction to the clinical practice guideline development process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical skills in collecting evidence, synthesis and reporting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategies to transition from evidence to recommendation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The workshop drew 76 AMS members from across the public healthcare institutions,
who also provided positive feedback by the end of the course.</p>

<p>Module 1 of the workshop began with a welcome address by A/Prof Danny
Soon, Chief Executive Officer, Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation
Singapore and Executive Director, SCRI.</p>
<p>During the session, participants grasped a clear understanding of how
the GRADE guidelines development methodology. will steer clinicians towardsevidence-based
and actionable Clinical Practice Guidelines for improved care outcomes.</p>

</p>
<p>In the first part of Module 2, conducted virtually, participants delved
into the theoretical aspects of conducting a literature search. They also
learnt the crucial skills needed for the critical appraisal of research
data and evidence synthesis, essential for developing therapeutic, prognosis
and diagnosis guidelines.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In the latter half of Module 2, participants could engage in group work
and lively discussions to show how well they understood the concept and
could effectively apply tools such as GRADEproGDT and MAGICapp to collate
evidence from eligible studies and generate a Summary of Findings (SoF)
table for further guideline development. The session also provided participants
with hands-on experience to reinforce their newly acquired skills through
practice scenarios.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>The final module focused on applying earlier collated evidence to achieve
a consensus for formal recommendations, ultimately culminating in a complete
clinical practice guideline.</p>
<p>The first segment of the module introduced participants to the theoretical
aspects of the GRADE evidence-to-decision framework, illustrating how the
framework could enhance consensus building among panels. Next, participants
were given the opportunity to actively engage in informing recommendations
within their respective workgroups.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participants were able to translate evidence from ten pre-specified outcomes
into weak recommendation in using corticosteroids in addition to standard
care in patients with sore throat. The conclusion was derived from the
tradeoff between the benefits and harms of the treatment, taking consideration
of other key elements such as certainty of evidence, values and preference,
and also resources.</p>

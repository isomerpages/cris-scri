**Programme Duration:** 10 September 2021 to 26 November 2021

**Venue:** Zoom (Online)

**Organiser:** SCRI Academy

SCRI Academy was delighted to welcome 28 Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs) to the latest edition of the CRC Level 1 Programme (Blended) held from September to November 2021.

The 12-week virtual programme consists of classroom demonstrations, role-playing sessions and case scenarios on the application of core CRC skills in daily operations and duties. Participants also shared their experiences and insights with one another through interactive virtual classrooms discussions.

Speakers such as Dr Grace Zeng from the Ministry of Health, Ms Maureen Crocker from ResMed and Ms Michellore Aguilar from SingHealth also discussed insights with the attendees on topics such as the Human Biomedical Research Act, elements of protocol and the operational challenges of early-phase trials from a CRC perspective.

To reinforce key concepts and skills, SCRI Academy trainer Ms Tan Siew Hoon conducted a quiz to test participants’ knowledge before their exam and oral assessment. Attendees also had the opportunity to clarify any questions in a 1-to-1 coaching session with SCRI trainers at the end of the course.

“I learnt a lot from the lecturers as well as other participants who shared their work experiences over the 12-week programme. This course is essential for a new CRC like me,” one participant commented.

Since launching the CRC training programme in 2018, SCRI has trained over 200 CRCs and have continuously reviewed and enhanced its courses through collaborations with clinical research personnel, public healthcare institutions, regulatory authorities and various training partners. We thank our collaborators for their continuous support on this journey.

Once again, congratulations to all graduating CRCs who completed the programme!

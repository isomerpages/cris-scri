Working in small groups, we spent time formulating and refining questions suitable for systematic review. Subsequent sessions focused on the different stages of the review process, including selecting studies, appraising trial quality, combining studies using meta-analysis, data extraction, and understanding publication bias. We finished by exploring the writing up process and the process used by the Cochrane Collaboration to disseminate the reviews.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2015/Untitled_3.jpg"></div><p><br>The target audience includes:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Those who are considering or currently working on a Cochrane Systematic Review</p></li><li><p>Those who want to know more about the best methods of doing Systematic Reviews</p></li><li><p>Those who would like to understand Systematic Reviews and meta-analysis</p></li><li><p>Those who would like to learn how to appraise the quality of Systematic Reviews</p></li></ul><p></p>

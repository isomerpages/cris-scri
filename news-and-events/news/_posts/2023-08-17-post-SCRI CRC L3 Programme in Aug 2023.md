<p><strong>Driving Excellence and Honing Leadership and Management Skills for Senior Clinical Research Coordinators</strong>
</p>
<p>This August, SCRI Academy was thrilled to welcome 20 Senior Clinical Research
Coordinators (CRCs) and managers for the second run of the CRC Level 3
Programme.</p>
<p>Held once a year, this Level 3 programme is the latest addition to SCRI
Academy’s suite of CRC training programmes, and it is the most advanced
course offered by SCRI Academy to senior CRCs with at least five years’
experience in managing clinical trials and clinical research studies.</p>
<p>Throughout the four-day programme, the CRC leaders were engaged in problem-based
learning and classroom discussions to learn about the key systematic process
in clinical research operations such as department resource planning, as
well as role-playing exercises to practice the soft skills learnt in an
applicable setting. These are essential skills as senior CRCs step-up to
become team leaders who not only oversee the daily operations within the
department, but also mentor their juniors and be a role-model for them.</p>

<p><em>Participants deeply engaged in group discussions about stakeholder management and the finer details of clinical research operations.</em>
</p>
<p>SCRI Academy also invited guest speakers from the industry and the Health
Sciences Authority (HSA) to share their perspectives and insights with
the course attendees.</p>
<p>Two of the guest speakers included Dr Goh Siew Lee, Director, Patient
Recruitment &amp; Retention Management from Syneos Health and Ms Sumitra
Sachidanandan, Regulatory Consultant at the Innovation Office &amp; Clinical
Trials Branch from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).</p>
<p>Dr Goh offered insights and shared useful strategies for overcoming hurdles
when recruiting participants to join a clinical research study. These include
reaching out to patient advocacy groups, speaking to other colleagues who
can help share information about the study across their networks, or listening
to potential participants to hear them out and address their concerns or
fears.</p>

</p>
<p>In clinical trials, maintaining a high level of compliance is a key determining
factor in achieving quality research results and ensuring the rights, safety
and well-being of the patients. As such, when non-conformities have been
identified, swift corrective and prevention action plans (CAPA) have to
be taken to eliminate the causes of non-conformities and to prevent its
recurrence.</p>
<p>Ms Sumitra shared six steps of planning and developing a CAPA plan, including
identifying the problem, evaluating the impact, performing root cause analysis,
developing, implementing and following-up on the CAPA plan. The attendees
were also guided on how to apply these steps through various case studies.</p>

</p>
<p>SCRI Academy also invited various corporate trainers to share on topics
such as advance stakeholder management, leadership and coaching skills,
and how to craft effective emails respectively. These courses helped participants
understand the importance of context-setting or how staying mindful of
potential cultural sensitivities when working with stakeholders can make
a difference in building trust, establishing open communication and effective
conflict management.</p>
<p>Throughout these sessions, attendees were introduced to the various management
skills and refined their soft skills in mentorship and communication. This
will help them mentor their team as well as manage various stakeholders
such as principal investigators, study sponsors and trial site managers.</p>

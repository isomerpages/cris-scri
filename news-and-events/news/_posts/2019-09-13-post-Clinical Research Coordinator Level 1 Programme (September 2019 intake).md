Hailing from various healthcare institutions from across the country, the CRCs were able to delve into the details about clinical operations in Singapore.</p><p>Since the SCRI Academy’s launch of the programme in 2018, it has been collaborating with the Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) School of Health &amp; Social Sciences. This collaboration included having an NYP lecturer speak on the topic of the Essentials in Clinical Practice, and was in the form of a full-day module. As part of the 12-week programme, the module equipped CRCs with fundamental knowledge and principles on Singapore’s healthcare system and clinical practice, specifically in the context of clinical research. These principles were reinforced through classroom demonstrations, role-play and case scenarios.</p><p>Upon successfully completing this module, all participating CRCs received a certificate from NYP. This is in addition to the CRC Level 1 Programme certificate that the CRCs received upon completing and achieving the overall passing grade.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2019/1_2.jpg"></div><p>CRCs participating in a role-play exercise at NYP’s School of Health &amp; Social Sciences.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/News 2019/2_2.jpg"></div><p>CRCs running through various case scenarios during the full-day module.</p>

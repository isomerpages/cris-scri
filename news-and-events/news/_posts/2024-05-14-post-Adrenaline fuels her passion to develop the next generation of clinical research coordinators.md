<p>Geraldine relishes an active role in advancing clinical research and technology.</p>
<p>As a manager at the Clinical Trials and Research Unit (CTRU), which is
part of the Research Office of Changi General Hospital (CGH), Geraldine
leads a team of 25 staff that supports CGH research clinicians across over
100 research studies. It is no easy feat, as these studies range from examining
drug efficacy or introducing new medical devices to complement patient
care or observational studies that contribute to clinical research.</p>
<p>The CTRU centralises resources and efficiently supports research activities
in CGH, in both investigator-led studies and sponsored trials. The team
aids researchers in grant applications, ethics and regulatory submissions,
study initiation to completion, as well as publication.</p>
<p>In her 12-year career as a clinical research coordinator (CRC), Geraldine
finds fulfillment in coordinating and supporting the delivery of research
outcomes from bench to bedside.</p>

<h4><strong>Supporting early intervention and preventive health for patients with primary aldosteronism</strong></h4>
<p>Among all patients with hypertension in Singapore, including those with
the more commonly known salt-sensitive hypertension, about 5% have primary
aldosteronism hypertension – a lesser-known and curable form of hypertension.
These patients are at a higher risk of developing heart disease, stroke,
and kidney failure compared to regular patients with hypertension. However,
despite the higher prevalence, many patients with primary aldosteronism
are not screened and treated.</p>
<p>Since 2016, Geraldine has been closely involved in a multi-centre, multi-study
research project led by Clinical Assistant Professor Troy Puar, Head and
Senior Consultant, Department of Endocrinology, CGH, which focuses on enhancing
outcomes for patients with primary aldosteronism. With her clinical research
expertise, she supports the Principal Investigators (PIs) and guides her
research staff in the various clinical studies, some of which are nationally
funded. She also works closely with the study teams to conceptualise the
study framework, operational needs, draft essential documents, analyse
the study’s challenges, and offer solutions.</p>
<p>Geraldine’s experience in organising and overseeing the patients and coordinators
across the institutions is integral to the studies’ success. In February
2023, CGH successfully launched clinical blood tests to accurately identify
and diagnose those with primary aldosteronism at the Shimadzu-CGH Clinomics
Centre (SC<sup>3</sup>).</p>

<h4><strong>Keeping pace and building rapport</strong></h4>
<p>Although the fast-paced work may be intimidating for young CRCs, she shares
that the adrenaline is invigorating and fuels her passion for research,
almost akin to the thrill and excitement from horror and apocalyptic movies,
which she enjoys. What captivates her is the way characters respond in
dire situations.</p>
<p>While the context of her work as a CRC differs from the fictional scenarios
depicted in horror movies, Geraldine draws parallel lessons from the films
that teamwork is a significant part of navigating the complex landscape
of clinical research. She also credits these movies for helping her to
reflect and cultivating her ability to remain calm and resilient in high-pressure
situations.</p>
<p>Earlier in her career, Geraldine was a transplant coordinator for patients
on the waiting list for a new organ, which involved shift work around a
24-hour roster. However, after she became a mum, she was looking for a
role with regular hours and transitioned to become a CRC.</p>
<p>“Similar to being a transplant coordinator, as a CRC, you are involved
with the patient from the initial recruitment to assessing their suitability
for the trial. In fact, you follow some patients for many years. Despite
the long journey through the research process, it offers the opportunity
to witness new developments in patient treatment and clinical practices,”
she explained.</p>
<p>Through follow-ups with patients over the years, she is heartened by the
trust established where they share their feedback with her.</p>
<p>Geraldine highlights that the strong rapport built with patients allows
for a smoother management of trials as they may be more likely to adhere
to study protocol and seek help when having enquiries. When CRCs are able
to address their queries, this allows Principal Investigators (PIs) to
focus on the broader scientific and medical aspects of the trial.</p>
<p>This approach helps drive collaborative synergy between CRCs and PIs,
allowing both roles to utilise their specific expertise more effectively
– trial coordination and medical background – to advance research together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“PIs, CRCs and patients form fundamental pillars in CGH’s research ecosystem
as we drive new discoveries, improve outcomes and transform care delivery,
for the better health of our community in Singapore and beyond,” Geraldine
shared.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>Strengthening relationships and growing the CRC career path at SingHealth</strong></h4>
<p>Apart from taking care of trial participants, Geraldine also oversees
the technical aspects of study operations and overseeing the development
of CRCs. Recognised for her ability to connect with and empower others,
Geraldine was selected for the administration pathway under <a href="https://www.singhealthdukenus.com.sg/research/ctcc/developing-our-clinical-trials-or-research-enablers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SingHealth's CRC Career Development Plan (CDP)</a> in
2015, a framework meant to facilitate career progression in the cluster.</p>
<p>Engaging with junior CRCs, she seeks to understand their competencies
and guide them towards leadership roles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whatever we promise to do, we need to deliver,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through her years of experience, she emphasises to her team that transparency
and resilience is key to building trust with patients and clinicians for
successful study outcomes.</p>
<p>Her love for nurturing others extends beyond the work environment; Geraldine
fosters a collaborative spirit and camaraderie through team outings and
activities like karaoke sessions.</p>
<p>She finds fulfilment in witnessing the growth of the individuals she mentored
and patients she has encountered through the many studies, echoing the
sentiment with a background chorus of Rachel Platten's 'Fight Song’, reinvigorating
her commitment to her work and the people she supports as the hospital
innovates healthcare for tomorrow.</p>

Many were able to gain insight to other CRCs’ personal work experiences, in addition to their institution’s best practices when conducting clinical trials. During the course of the 12 weeks, they were also able learn from trainers who provided guidance and offered tips on how to perform better as a CRC.</p><p>By the end of the programme, lasting friendships and connections were forged, making it easier for CRCs to build a network support group among themselves.

<p>Clinical research presents opportunities for clinicians to better understand
diseases and advance new treatment methods that offer hope for patients.
New technologies are also used to develop treatments and advance medical
diagnostics, including devices that enable early detection of diseases
so that patients can be provided with early treatment for improved outcomes.</p>
<p>Chew Ying Jia is a Senior Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) at the Department
of Surgery, National University Hospital, who is now in her eighth year
in the clinical research field. Over her career, Ying Jia has developed
her interest in advancing women’s health, especially in supporting early
screening for breast cancer.</p>
<p>She finds her chosen career in research fulfilling, as she had always
been a “naturally curious person” and Biology was her favourite subject
in school. She was also inspired by her mother and sister who are both
pharmacists, to embark on a career that can make an impact in healthcare
and help others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Compared to conducting research studies in the lab during my time at
university, where there were fewer chances for many face-to-face meetings,
as a CRC today, I get to engage with patients while still contributing
to scientific research. This job has allowed me to experience the best
of both worlds,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A milestone year in Ying Jia’s career was in 2021, where she helmed the
set-up of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359641005_BREAst_screening_Tailored_for_HEr_BREATHE-A_study_protocol_on_personalised_risk-based_breast_cancer_screening_programme" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore’s first risk-based breast cancer screening research programme, Breast Screening Tailored for Her (BREATHE)</a>,
while she was working at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, one of the study’s
recruitment site.</p>
<p>Breast cancer is a complex disease, and current clinical guidelines which
uses age as a marker of when to start screening may not be adequate. The
BREATHE study looks at augmenting the current screening guidelines to a
risk-based approach, by estimating a woman’s risk for developing breast
cancer (based on genetic<s> </s>and non-genetic lifestyle, and environmental
risk factors), and with that knowledge, translate that into a plan on an
appropriate age to start screening.</p>
<p>The cohort study involves multiple stakeholders ranging from research
institutes, public hospital outpatient clinics and polyclinics, targeting
to recruit approximately 4,000 women. Ying Jia took on the mammoth task
of establishing the research programme’s study protocol and operational
workflow from scratch, which would be implemented across six recruitment
sites.</p>
<p>“Due to the heightened COVID-19 social distancing measures which were
still in place in 2021, most of our CRCs could not join us physically due
to restrictions on cross-institution interaction. Therefore, we had to
pivot our training online,” she shared.</p>
<p>Ying Jia and her team did not allow the lack of facetime deter them. They
overcame logistical challenges and focused on refining workflows and improving
training materials, such that teams could operate effectively even in the
absence of face-to-face training. Ying Jia ensured the smooth progress
of the study recruitment, follow-up with recruited participants and engaged
the team of CRCs from all participating institutions via virtual meetings
to alleviate any concerns and enhance communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the recruitment process for BREATHE, she discovered that healthy
women had less incentive to take part in the study as compared to hospitalised
patients. “We had to be patient in understanding their concerns first and
then to address their misconceptions,” Ying Jia highlighted.</p>
<p>For instance, one common misconception which healthy volunteers had was
that they thought that there were at low risk of developing breast cancer
as they were young and led relatively healthy lifestyles. In reality however,
their risk of developing breast cancer could be high due to a complex combination
of factors such as genetics, lifestyle and the environment. As a daughter
and sister herself, Ying Jia would highlight the benefits of early screening
through public education.</p>
<p>“We also encourage study participants to get their family members and
relatives to undergo early screening. Their participation in research studies
such as BREATHE have the potential to spreading word on screening guidelines
that will benefit others such as their younger sisters and daughters,”
she said.</p>
<p>In a short span of two years, the programme exceeded recruitment targets
and enrolled over 4,200 women between ages of 35 and 59. The team of CRCs
are now in active follow-up with women who are in the programme till 2025.</p>
<h4><strong>Assuming the role as a mentor and beyond</strong></h4>
<p>Beyond her technical expertise, Ying Jia assumes the role of a mentor
to her younger colleagues. She often stresses the importance of empathy.
“You have to take care of your team as well,” she said.</p>
<p>She actively seeks to understand her colleagues and participants' perspectives.
When her mentees face challenges at recruitment sites, she takes a listening
approach to hear them out and create a safe space within her team.</p>

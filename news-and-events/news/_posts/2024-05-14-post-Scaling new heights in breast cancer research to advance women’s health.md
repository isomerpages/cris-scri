<p>Clinical research presents opportunities for clinicians to better understand
diseases and advance new treatment methods that offer hope for patients.
New technologies are also used to develop treatments and advance medical
diagnostics, including devices that enable early detection of diseases
so that patients can be provided with early treatment for improved outcomes.</p>
<p>Chew Ying Jia is a Senior Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) at the Department
of Surgery, National University Hospital, who is now in her eighth year
in the clinical research field. Over her career, Ying Jia has developed
her interest in advancing women’s health, especially in supporting early
screening for breast cancer.</p>
<p>She finds her chosen career in research fulfilling, as she had always
been a “naturally curious person” and Biology was her favourite subject
in school. She was also inspired by her mother and sister who are both
pharmacists, to embark on a career that can make an impact in healthcare
and help others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Compared to conducting research studies in the lab during my time at
university, where there were fewer chances for many face-to-face meetings,
as a CRC today, I get to engage with patients while still contributing
to scientific research. This job has allowed me to experience the best
of both worlds,” she said.</p>

</p>
<p>A milestone year in Ying Jia’s career was in 2021, where she helmed the
set-up of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359641005_BREAst_screening_Tailored_for_HEr_BREATHE-A_study_protocol_on_personalised_risk-based_breast_cancer_screening_programme" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore’s first risk-based breast cancer screening research programme, Breast Screening Tailored for Her (BREATHE)</a>,
while she was working at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, one of the study’s
recruitment site.</p>
<p>Breast cancer is a complex disease, and current clinical guidelines which
uses age as a marker of when to start screening may not be adequate. The
BREATHE study looks at augmenting the current screening guidelines to a
risk-based approach, by estimating a woman’s risk for developing breast
cancer (based on genetic<s> </s>and non-genetic lifestyle, and environmental
risk factors), and with that knowledge, translate that into a plan on an
appropriate age to start screening.</p>
<p>The cohort study involves multiple stakeholders ranging from research
institutes, public hospital outpatient clinics and polyclinics, targeting
to recruit approximately 4,000 women. Ying Jia took on the mammoth task
of establishing the research programme’s study protocol and operational
workflow from scratch, which would be implemented across six recruitment
sites.</p>
<p>“Due to the heightened COVID-19 social distancing measures which were
still in place in 2021, most of our CRCs could not join us physically due
to restrictions on cross-institution interaction. Therefore, we had to
pivot our training online,” she shared.</p>
<p>Ying Jia and her team did not allow the lack of facetime deter them. They
overcame logistical challenges and focused on refining workflows and improving
training materials, such that teams could operate effectively even in the
absence of face-to-face training. Ying Jia ensured the smooth progress
of the study recruitment, follow-up with recruited participants and engaged
the team of CRCs from all participating institutions via virtual meetings
to alleviate any concerns and enhance communication.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>During the recruitment process for BREATHE, she discovered that healthy
women had less incentive to take part in the study as compared to hospitalised
patients. “We had to be patient in understanding their concerns first and
then to address their misconceptions,” Ying Jia highlighted.</p>
<p>For instance, one common misconception which healthy volunteers had was
that they thought that there were at low risk of developing breast cancer
as they were young and led relatively healthy lifestyles. In reality however,
their risk of developing breast cancer could be high due to a complex combination
of factors such as genetics, lifestyle and the environment. As a daughter
and sister herself, Ying Jia would highlight the benefits of early screening
through public education.</p>
<p>“We also encourage study participants to get their family members and
relatives to undergo early screening. Their participation in research studies
such as BREATHE have the potential to spreading word on screening guidelines
that will benefit others such as their younger sisters and daughters,”
she said.</p>
<p>In a short span of two years, the programme exceeded recruitment targets
and enrolled over 4,200 women between ages of 35 and 59. The team of CRCs
are now in active follow-up with women who are in the programme till 2025.</p>
<h4><strong>Assuming the role as a mentor and beyond</strong></h4>
<p>Beyond her technical expertise, Ying Jia assumes the role of a mentor
to her younger colleagues. She often stresses the importance of empathy.
“You have to take care of your team as well,” she said.</p>
<p>She actively seeks to understand her colleagues and participants' perspectives.
When her mentees face challenges at recruitment sites, she takes a listening
approach to hear them out and create a safe space within her team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ying Jia mentors over 20 junior CRCs across NUHS. Though she has assumed
the role of a clinical research manager, she fondly recalls her days as
a research coordinator, running the groundwork. “When they feel comfortable
to share their difficulties with you, it means there is a level of trust
present,” she said.</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>Ying Jia's favourite pastime is hiking – scaling heights to reach the
peak which mirrors her work in setting up well-functioning and organised
research programmes. Despite the uphill challenge that clinical research
presents in “venturing into unchartered terrain”, Ying Jia also experiences
the satisfaction that comes from scaling new heights in clinical research.</p>
<p>A recent personal milestone of hers, was reaching the summit of Mount
Kinabalu (Mt KK), the highest peak in Malaysia at 4,095 metres above sea
level. She shared that this achievement was not without regular training
sessions on various hiking trails in Singapore to gradually build up stamina
– whether it’s the Rail Corridor, MacRitchie Reservoir or Bukit Timah Nature
Reserve, she has conquered them all in the lead-up to the expedition to
scale Mt KK.</p>
<p>Drawing parallels to her hiking experiences, she highlighted that trails
are marked out by the people who precede them. She finds inspiration in
setting the course and laying the groundwork for the next generation of
hikers, ensuring that those who follow have a well-laid foundation to build
upon.</p>
<p>She often advises her mentees: “If you are given a good opportunity, pursue
it and learn from there,” she stressed. She would arrange face-to-face
meetings with institutional partners so that they can share updates, challenges
and analysis from data collected. This approach allows her CRCs to see
the fruits of their labour and learn from their peers as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Reaching the summit takes time, once you finally do reach the peak, you
realise how breath-taking the view is. All the work you put in to get to
the top would have been worth it,” she reflected on going the distance
as a CRC.</p>

</p>
<p>Presently, Ying Jia is the project lead for a pilot trial at the National
University Hospital (NUH), focusing on the implementation of an AI-powered
tool to improve current screening performance and efficiency by assisting
radiologists in reading mammography images. The team will also <a href="https://www.fathomx.co/post/fxmammo-approved-by-hsa-and-wins-award-in-healthcare-innomatch-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">explore the possibility to scale up the project within public healthcare. This will accelerate the development of a market-ready AI assistant for breast cancer diagnosis</a>.</p>
<p>Ying Jia aspires to visit the Everest base camp one day, which mirrors
her professional ambition to scale new heights in advancing women’s health
— a climb she deems the most purposeful and worthwhile in her CRC journey.</p>

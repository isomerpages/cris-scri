<p>Clinical trials drive impactful patient, healthcare, and economic outcomes
and are at the core of translational research – transforming results from
research studies into innovative applications that benefit people. Trials
focusing on significant public health issues that are particularly relevant
to Singapore can provide valuable insights into local healthcare systems
for professionals regarding optimal prevention and treatment methods.</p>
<p>Clinical research coordinators (CRCs) form the bedrock of Singapore’s
clinical research ecosystem. They are instrumental, not only in advancing
clinical trials but more importantly, ensuring the integrity and quality
of the clinical research studies. CRCs play a critical role in translating
research into real-world health solutions.</p>

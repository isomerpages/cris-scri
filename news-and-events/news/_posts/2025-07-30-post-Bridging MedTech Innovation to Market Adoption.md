<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the medical device
sector, with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorising over
1,000 AI-enabled devices in total as of August 2024. There has been a dramatic
rise from just six approvals in 2015 to 235 in 2024.</p>
<p>Singapore, as a regional hub for MedTech innovation, is also experiencing
growth in this space, driven by a vibrant ecosystem of startups, academic
spin-offs, and industry leaders. As AI-powered solutions become more prevalent,
the path to successful adoption hinges on robust clinical usability studies,
formative research, and comprehensive clinical trial data. These elements
are essential to demonstrate real-world value and ensure patient safety.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the programme, Ms Koh Kah Leng, Senior Regulatory Specialist,
Health Sciences Authority (HSA) will present on the evolving regulatory
framework for AI-enabled medical devices, highlighting how updated guidelines
and a lifecycle regulatory approach will support the next wave of MedTech
innovation and adoption. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who should attend</strong>
</p>
<p>This is an event to gain clarity on early engagement with regulators for
novel devices and network with key stakeholders from industry, academia,
and government agencies‚Äîall working together to advance healthcare. We
look forward to supporting MedTechs‚Äô journey from bench to bedside.</p>

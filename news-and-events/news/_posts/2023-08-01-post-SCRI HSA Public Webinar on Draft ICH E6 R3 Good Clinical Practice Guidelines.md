<p>Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines are essential for research, particularly
for clinical trials. These guidelines serve as a beacon to steer researchers
to uphold rigorous research protocol while safeguarding and protecting
the welfare of research participants in a clinical trial or study.</p>
<p>The GCP guidelines are in place to maintain data integrity, protect against
potential risks, and guarantee compliance with regulatory standards. When
complied with, researchers will be able to maintain highest ethical standards
and also enhance the credibility of their work.</p>
<p>These careful steps will in turn accelerate the advancement of new discoveries
and scientific knowledge that will drive the development of safer or more
effective medical therapeutics or interventions.</p>
<p>On 1 August 2023, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) co-hosted a public
webinar with SCRI Academy to provide an overview on the draft ICH E6 (R3)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline.</p>
<p>The event received an overwhelming response, attracting over 490 participants
locally and overseas from the clinical research industry, public healthcare
institutions and government agencies.</p>
<p>This session was conducted by Ms Sumitra Sachidanandan, Regulatory Consultant
at the Innovation Office &amp; Clinical Trials Branch of HSA.</p>
<p>The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is the national regulatory authority
of Singapore, which maintains regulatory oversight of clinical trials of
therapeutic products, cell, tissue and gene therapy products and medicinal
products (e.g. complementary health products), through evaluation of clinical
trial applications, monitoring of clinical trial safety and conduct of
GCP Inspections.</p>

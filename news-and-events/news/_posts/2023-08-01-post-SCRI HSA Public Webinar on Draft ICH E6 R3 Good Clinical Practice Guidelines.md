<p>Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines are essential for research, particularly
for clinical trials. These guidelines serve as a beacon to steer researchers
to uphold rigorous research protocol while safeguarding and protecting
the welfare of research participants in a clinical trial or study.</p>
<p>The GCP guidelines are in place to maintain data integrity, protect against
potential risks, and guarantee compliance with regulatory standards. When
complied with, researchers will be able to maintain highest ethical standards
and also enhance the credibility of their work.</p>
<p>These careful steps will in turn accelerate the advancement of new discoveries
and scientific knowledge that will drive the development of safer or more
effective medical therapeutics or interventions.</p>
<p>On 1 August 2023, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) co-hosted a public
webinar with SCRI Academy to provide an overview on the draft ICH E6 (R3)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline.</p>
<p>The event received an overwhelming response, attracting over 490 participants
locally and overseas from the clinical research industry, public healthcare
institutions and government agencies.</p>
<p>This session was conducted by Ms Sumitra Sachidanandan, Regulatory Consultant
at the Innovation Office &amp; Clinical Trials Branch of HSA.</p>
<p>The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is the national regulatory authority
of Singapore, which maintains regulatory oversight of clinical trials of
therapeutic products, cell, tissue and gene therapy products and medicinal
products (e.g. complementary health products), through evaluation of clinical
trial applications, monitoring of clinical trial safety and conduct of
GCP Inspections.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing the ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline</strong>
</p>
<p>The ICH* E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline is an international
ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording
and reporting clinical trials that involve the participation of human participants.
It aims to provide a unified standard for the ICH regions to facilitate
the mutual acceptance of clinical data by the regulatory authorities in
these jurisdictions.</p>
<p>HSA has been an observer to the ICH platform since 2007 and was accepted
as a Regulatory Member of the ICH in November 2017. HSA actively participates
in various ICH Expert Working Groups, including the ICH E6 (R3) Expert
Working Group.</p>
<p>Following the call for modernisation of clinical trials and subsequent
renovation of the ICH E6 (R2) GCP guideline, the ICH E6 (R3) Expert Working
Group has been working on revising the GCP guideline since Nov 2019.</p>
<p>The revised ICH E6 (R3) GCP guideline will facilitate innovation through
novel clinical trial designs (including the use of decentralised elements
and digital health technologies), and focuses on key concepts such as quality
by design, and adopting a fit for purpose and risk proportionate approach.</p>
<p><strong>What should we look out for in the ICH E6 (R3) GCP guideline</strong>
</p>
<p>Ms Sumitra shared that the draft ICH E6 (R3) GCP guideline will comprise
a principles document, Annex 1 (considerations for interventional clinical
trials) and Annex 2 (additional considerations for interventional clinical
trials).</p>
<p>She elaborated on the key changes to be incorporated into the principles
document and Annex 1 during the webinar. The attendees noted that a new
section on Data Governance for sponsors and investigators has been included,
and substantial changes have been made to the GCP principles, investigator,
sponsor, essential records, glossary and appendices sections of the revised
guideline.</p>
<p>The draft ICH E6 (R3) GCP guideline is expected to be published in end
2024. Once published, HSA will inform its stakeholders on the implementation
timelines for Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important</strong>
</p>
<p>As the ICH E6 (R3) GCP guideline will be a major revamp from the ICH E6
(R2) GCP guideline, and it would be crucial for sponsors and investigators
to be re-trained on the revised guideline and revise their Quality Management
Systems in order to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>The principles document and Annex 1 of the draft ICH E6 (R3) GCP guideline
are currently available for <a href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/therapeutic-products/international-collaboration/ich" class="app-aware-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">public consultation</a> till
30 September 2023. The draft Annex 2 guideline will be shared at a later
date.</p>
<p>The webinar concluded with a 75-min question and answer session, with
over 80 questions addressed.</p>
<p>The attendees gave their virtual thumbs-up to express their appreciation
towards Ms Sumitra and the HSA’s dedication towards international collaboration.</p>

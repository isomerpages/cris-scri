SCRI held its 3rd Annual Scientific Symposium on 29 August 2017 at Conrad Centennial Singapore, during which the SCRI Academy was launched. SCRI would like to especially thank our Guest-of-Honour, Dr. Lam Pin Min, Senior Minister, Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Health, for his support in gracing this event and for delivering the opening address. SCRI Academy is a virtual academy for existing research coordinators who have less than one year's experience. 

Our theme for this Symposium is "Advancing Clinical Research through Expertise Development". Featuring several distinguished local and overseas speakers, this Symposium aims to broaden the horizon of the local clinical research practices so that we can better tackle the challenges of tomorrow. This year, our partner, the National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC), organised a parallel session in the afternoon on aspects of healthcare innovation and commercialisation. The focus of expertise development is epitomised by the launch of SCRI Academy to house the learning and development programmes for Clinical Research Coordinators in Singapore.

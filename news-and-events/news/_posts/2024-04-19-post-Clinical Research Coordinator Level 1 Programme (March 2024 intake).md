<p>The CRC Level 1 Programme is a comprehensive introduction to how clinical
trials are run. The course is tailored for junior clinical research coordinators
(with at least one year experience) and provide practical training involving
real-world case studies and hands-on application of skills through role-play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In March 2024, SCRI Academy welcomed 36 junior CRCs to the 12<sup>th</sup> cohort
of the CRC Level 1 Programme.</p>

</p>
<p>The seven-week programme offered a strong foundation for participants
to effectively carry out their duties as a CRCs in public healthcare institutions
such as hospitals and polyclinics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme kicked off with a Bingo ice-breaker game for participants
from various public healthcare institutions to get to know one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thereafter, lessons began proper, and the junior CRCs were introduced
to the range of clinical trial activities from study initiation to closure.
They also discussed the importance of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), understanding
their responsibilities in supporting Principal Investigators (PIs), and
guidelines to follow when it comes to research reporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For hands-on skills, they practised the steps in gaining informed
consent from trial participants, as well learnt useful tips on how to maintain
research documents, as well as how to collect quality data and fundamentals
of data entry.</p>
<p>The regulatory requirements and guideline protocols for clinical trials
conducted in Singapore were also taught during the programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Participants were invited to ask questions and queries raised were
swiftly clarified during the programme. Read on below for useful tips for
junior CRCs:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Do I need to start a new delegation log when
there is a change in PI?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. The CRC must close the delegation log for
the previous PI by entering the end date (i.e. the date of study handover).
Following this, a new delegation log should be created for the new PI,
re-delegating the study team members with a start date that begins immediately
after the end date of the previous PI.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> After the amended protocol version has been
approved by IRB and regulatory authorities, can the study team discard
the previous version to save storage space?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, all versions of the documents should be retained
in the investigator site file and archived in accordance with the institution’s
policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the difference between pre-screening
and screening when considering potential trial participants for clinical
trials?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Pre-screening is a preliminary step that does
not entail any study procedures. It aims to identify potential participants
whom doctors or investigators can approach to find out if they are keen
to join the study. If a potential participant expresses interest, the investigators
will seek their consent before proceeding with screening activities, which
may include lab tests, physical examinations, and data collection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The course was taught by an experienced team of trainers from both the
public and private sector organisations from the clinical research industry.
They drew from their vast experience in clinical trials and provided the
participants with actionable tips on how to overcome challenges faced in
the course of their work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCRI Academy would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to all training
partners – Nanyang Polytechnic, Health Sciences Authority, Labcorp Drug
Development Pte Ltd. and Ms Michellore Aguillar from the SingHealth Investigational
Medicine Unit – for their unwavering support throughout the programme.</p>

</p>
<p>By the end of the course, participants shared that they found the group
discussions and role-play activities provided good opportunities for them
to practise their newfound skills. They also gained a better understanding
of the job responsibilities of a CRC and felt more assured that they are
not alone in this career, and can always approach a senior staff or colleague
for assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Armed with new knowledge from the course, participants commented that
they now felt more confident to manage clinical trials, as well as navigate
tricky situations should they encounter similar situations in future.</p>

<p>In early 2020, while the world juggled between building its frontline
defence against COVID-19 and finding a new normal through pandemic hobbies
such as perfecting sourdough starters, Nur Qasrina Binte Iskandar Lim graduated
with a degree in Life Science and was looking forward to becoming a working
adult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, Qasrina soon grew disheartened when her job search did
not seem to progress into anything concrete.</p>
<p>“As I saw my peers securing job offers, I kept thinking when will it be
my turn? Am I not good enough?” she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A turning point in Qasrina’s job search came when her batchmate
who had joined National University Hospital (NUH) as a Clinical Research
Coordinator (CRC), posted a job opening on LinkedIn. While it was not a
profession she was familiar with, it opened up new possibilities for her
career.</p>
<p>When she read up more about the profession, Qasrina realised that there
were CRC positions available across public healthcare institutions in Singapore
and the job scope appealed to her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The opportunity to contribute to healthcare research and make a difference
for patients intrigued me,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, she had only applied to jobs that were well-known in the science
field, such as those of a research assistant or medical writer.</p>

</p>
<p>In May 2021, Qasrina began her role as a CRC in NUH, marking a fresh start
in her career.</p>
<p>Her first two weeks of training and orientation were a balancing act,
as she had to quickly get up to speed in unfamiliar tasks such as patient
recruitment and data collection. It was overwhelming at first, as each
day required her to apply the new skills she had picked up during the orientation.</p>
<p>These include patient consent-taking, patient recruitment for cohort studies,
gathering logistics and ensuring the collection of quality data and data
entry.</p>
<p>CRCs are professionals who have core skills and knowledge to run clinical
trials and research studies. This consists of both soft skills and hard
skills.</p>
<p>“My science degree and prior experience in clinical research would help
me grasp concepts such as study protocols and research monitoring more
quickly,” shared Qasrina.</p>
<p>As a newcomer however, she faced difficulties in recruiting patients.
Qasrina persisted and sought guidance from senior CRCs to refine her recruitment
strategies and began building rapport with nurses from whom she learnt
skills in patient engagement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I kept a resilient mindset by approaching each patient with empathy and
to address their anxieties,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning her own challenges as a new CRC into something valuable others
can benefit from, Qasrina designed an orientation programme to ease future
newcomers into the role. This included a training checklist which served
to help her juniors face significantly less challenges in coordinating
research studies, data entry, budget tracking and management and patient
interactions. Her thoughtful approach streamlined training processes, making
the learning curve for new CRCs less daunting.</p>
<h4><strong>Making steady strides in a new career: understanding patients on a deeper level</strong></h4>
<p>As a junior CRC, Qasrina was given the opportunity to work with various
departments across the hospital from internal medicine to infectious diseases
and the organ transplant unit.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Qasrina has been managing a cross-sectional dermatology
qualitative research study that focused on the care experience of over
1,000 patients who were being treated for their chronic eczema and psoriasis.</p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes heavy lifting included obtaining approval from regulatory
authorities, optimising participant recruitment strategies, improving workflows
and maintaining stakeholder relationships.</p>
<p>This cross-sectional study explored possible ways to improve the patient-physician
relationship.</p>
<p>The study’s findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association (JAMA) Dermatology in July 2023, and Qasrina and her team also
presented their research at a dermatology conference in San Diego in March
this year.</p>
<p>“It was nerve-wracking to speak to a room full of clinicians but a great
learning opportunity nonetheless,” she recounted.</p>

</p>
<p>Reflecting on the study, Qasrina expressed gratitude to the patients who
were involved in the research study, whose consent has facilitated advancements
in clinical research. In spite of the discomfort of their chronic conditions,
their commitment to keep showing up for their medical appointments and
research reviews has been an inspiration to Qasrina.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It really warms my heart when patients give feedback that their conditions
are improving,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Qasrina also shared that patient have conveyed their appreciation when
they learn about the research efforts to help them better manage their
chronic conditions and thanked the research team for the care and effort
poured into doing research in Dermatology even though their conditions
may not be life threatening.</p>
<h4><strong>CRC’s advanced clinical research seeks to achieve “small wins” that can re-shape future medical practice</strong></h4>
<p>These poignant moments have strengthened Qasrina's determination to continue
in her role as a CRC, contributing to the advancement of clinical research
studies for patients.</p>
<p>Reminded of the steps she took to get to where she is today, Qasrina firmly
believes that small wins, such as new discoveries from research studies,
can lead to big advances, potentially reshaping future medical practices
and refining the approach to patient consultations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As clinical research studies are conducted in phases, they can last for
months to years. “Despite the long journey, the studies do offer a ray
of hope to patients,” she reflected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The empowerment for CRCs to create a sustained impact and enhance patients’
lives on a broader scale, which Qasrina shared, is one area she aspired
for her future career to fulfil, back when she was a fresh university graduate.
Her role as a CRC, fittingly translated that hope into reality.</p>
<p>Qasrina offered this advice to others who are at career crossroads, “Stay
open to unexpected opportunities. Each experience serves as a stepping-stone
to develop skills and build resilience for future roles. Even if you have
veered from your initially envisioned path, trust that it will eventually
lead you to your desired destination.”</p>

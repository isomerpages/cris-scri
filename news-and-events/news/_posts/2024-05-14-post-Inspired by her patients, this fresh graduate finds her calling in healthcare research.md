<p>In early 2020, while the world juggled between building its frontline
defence against COVID-19 and finding a new normal through pandemic hobbies
such as perfecting sourdough starters, Nur Qasrina Binte Iskandar Lim graduated
with a degree in Life Science and was looking forward to becoming a working
adult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, Qasrina soon grew disheartened when her job search did
not seem to progress into anything concrete.</p>
<p>“As I saw my peers securing job offers, I kept thinking when will it be
my turn? Am I not good enough?” she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A turning point in Qasrina’s job search came when her batchmate
who had joined National University Hospital (NUH) as a Clinical Research
Coordinator (CRC), posted a job opening on LinkedIn. While it was not a
profession she was familiar with, it opened up new possibilities for her
career.</p>
<p>When she read up more about the profession, Qasrina realised that there
were CRC positions available across public healthcare institutions in Singapore
and the job scope appealed to her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The opportunity to contribute to healthcare research and make a difference
for patients intrigued me,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, she had only applied to jobs that were well-known in the science
field, such as those of a research assistant or medical writer.</p>
<p>In May 2021, Qasrina began her role as a CRC in NUH, marking a fresh start
in her career.</p>
<p>Her first two weeks of training and orientation were a balancing act,
as she had to quickly get up to speed in unfamiliar tasks such as patient
recruitment and data collection. It was overwhelming at first, as each
day required her to apply the new skills she had picked up during the orientation.</p>
<p>These include patient consent-taking, patient recruitment for cohort studies,
gathering logistics and ensuring the collection of quality data and data
entry.</p>
<p>CRCs are professionals who have core skills and knowledge to run clinical
trials and research studies. This consists of both soft skills and hard
skills.</p>
<p>“My science degree and prior experience in clinical research would help
me grasp concepts such as study protocols and research monitoring more
quickly,” shared Qasrina.</p>
<p>As a newcomer however, she faced difficulties in recruiting patients.
Qasrina persisted and sought guidance from senior CRCs to refine her recruitment
strategies and began building rapport with nurses from whom she learnt
skills in patient engagement.</p>
<p>“I kept a resilient mindset by approaching each patient with empathy and
to address their anxieties,” she said.</p>
<p>Turning her own challenges as a new CRC into something valuable others
can benefit from, Qasrina designed an orientation programme to ease future
newcomers into the role. This included a training checklist which served
to help her juniors face significantly less challenges in coordinating
research studies, data entry, budget tracking and management and patient
interactions. Her thoughtful approach streamlined training processes, making
the learning curve for new CRCs less daunting.</p>

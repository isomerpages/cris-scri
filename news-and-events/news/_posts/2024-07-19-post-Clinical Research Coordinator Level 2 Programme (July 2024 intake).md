<p>For the fourth run of the Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) Level 2
Programme in July 2024, SCRI Academy welcomed 30 CRCs from across the public
healthcare clusters. This programme is designed to equip CRCs with at least
two years of experience in coordinating clinical research studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The programme was spaced out across six weeks, and participants
acquired relevant knowledge and skills to coordinate for investigator-initiated
clinical research studies across different study design protocols. Th CRCs
were able to apply the skills they learnt progressively each week to the
clinical research studies they managed back in their respective institutions.</p>

<p>In the first week of the programme, CRCs learnt about the function and
responsibilities of trial sponsors in investigator-initiated trials (IIT)
as well as key concepts in project management such as planning ahead to
optimise allocation of resources and finding solutions to overcome limitations
and building rapport to facilitate stakeholder management. Participants
learnt strategies on how to maintain the quality of research data gathered
from the study, and why robust clinical data is key in contributing to
the success of clinical trials. The programme also took a deep dive into
core clinical research processes such as conducting protocol reviews, safety
monitoring, and assessing site feasibility.</p>
<p>In the second week, participants were exposed to a series of hands-on
learning which included how to manage resources, budget planning, apply
for research grants and data collected in a study, designing a study, coordinating
investigator and site initiation meetings, as well as keeping updated on
the current Institutional Review Board (IRB), ethics and regulatory requirements
for clinical research.</p>
<p>In the final week, the CRCs were introduced to strategies to overcome
challenges met in patient recruitment and other career pathways they can
explore in Project Management. The last stretch of lessons featured key
topics on proper handling of clinical research samples and biological specimens
and how to correctly chart checklists for study monitoring, inspections,
and site closure.</p>
<p>Throughout the programme, participants were given opportunities to practice
and apply the skills that they had gained through classroom activities
and case scenario discussions.</p>

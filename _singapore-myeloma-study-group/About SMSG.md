<h3><strong>About the Singapore Myeloma Study Group (SMSG)</strong></h3>
<p>The Singapore Myeloma Study Group (SMSG) was established to carry out
research including clinical trials to bring promising new treatment to
Singapore Myeloma patients. We also form the expert group in Singapore
that develop practice guidelines. Members comprise myeloma experts from
public and private healthcare organizations in Singapore. Many of the members
are also part of the Asian Myeloma Network (AMN), formed under the auspices
of the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF), and are active in leading
and driving many of AMNâ€™s activities including clinical trials, physician
education and patient support outreach through the network.</p>
<p>The SMSG is currently led by Prof Chng Wee Joo, Executive Director of
the Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium.</p>

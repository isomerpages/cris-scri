### Health Economics and Outcomes Research

**Headed by Shi Luming**

Our supports to Health Economics and Outcomes Research comprise:

*   Project collaboration by providing pre- and post- grand supports
    
*   Evaluation of health services programmes
    
*   Development of disease registries 
    
*   Real-world data analytics
    

#### Our team’s core functions mainly cover 4 key areas: 

**Project Collaboration** - Our HEOR team has extensive experience in collaborating with clinical domain experts to develop quality protocols for health economics and outcomes research projects, especially for multi-centre studies. We advise on all aspects of protocol design to meet regulatory and funding requirements. We are among the first few pioneer teams incorporated health economic evaluation into grant application. With our members’ medical training background as well as solid clinical research foundations, we are the clinicians’ ideal partners to help them quickly translate a research question into a valid and feasible research plan. HEOR investigations not only improve the potential to provide the best care at the lowest cost to our patients but also influence the formation of healthcare policies relevant to our population’s needs. 

Our HEOR department forms the nucleus of health economic evaluation expertise at SCRI, and we provide technical support and showed scientific leadership to help local clinical researchers incorporate health economic evaluation into their research projects. We supported many health outcomes projects in different therapeutic areas. Our senior members have many years of working experience in handling real world patient data from hospitals, disease registries, and administrative data from MOH. In addition, we are expanding our training services to cover emerging fields in health outcomes research and health technology assessment, such as health services evaluation, digital health and diagnostic test accuracy research. With these initiatives in place, we hope to equip local researchers to meet the future demand for knowledge on patient outcomes and value-added health services.

**Consultancy support** - We worked closely with hospital research departments and institutes to build up their research capabilities, widen the talent pipelines and grow a larger pool of committed and skilled research professionals, which benefited young/new investigators especially, so that they can start their research journey more confidently with our partnership. 

  
**Scientific Review** - Due to our wide exposures to clinical research projects, we are recognized as experienced and well respected methodologists. We received invites to review grant applications, journal manuscripts, conference abstracts and theses of post-graduate students. Some project teams invited us as Co-Is after receiving our review comments and recommendations.

**Training Workshops** - In order to nurture clinical research capabilities and timely introduce new methods and skills to local research community, we are the 1st team in Singapore started providing Health Economic Evaluation alongside Clinical Studies and Network Meta-analysis workshops. We also brought in and introduced the Cochrane’s method on Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) evidence synthesis to Singapore in the same year as the new method was established by Cochrane DTA Group. All our workshops were full house and received very positive feedback from our participants. Our participants were from MOH including ACE, and universities including NUS, Duke-NUS, and LKC; the other majorities were clinicians, nurses, and researchers from public healthcare organizations.

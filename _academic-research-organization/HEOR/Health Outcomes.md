### Evidence Synthesis

**Headed by Shi Luming**

##### Evidence Synthesis services comprise:

*   Development of systematic methodology to promote evidence-based medicine
    
*   Conducting synthesis of quantitative evidence to evaluate efficacy and cost-effectiveness
    
*   Use of systematic reviews to identify knowledge gaps, assess health services and inform decision-making
    
*   Support production of high quality systematic reviews for the Cochrane Collaboration
    

SCRI's HEOR team supports the practice of evidence-based medicine by developing and teaching review methodologies. Our staff are well-versed in both clinical and research methodology to ensure the successful conduct of high quality and clinically relevant systematic reviews and evidence syntheses. Through the conduct of tailor-made and interactive training workshops, we actively contribute our expertise to help clinical researchers in evidence synthesis. In recent years, we have shifted our focus from traditional interventional studies to meet the emerging demand for evidence synthesis in health economic evaluation and diagnostic test accuracy projects. We are also expanding our training and education activities to cover these new emerging interests. Through these endeavours, we hope to encourage more local researchers to contribute by filling in knowledge gaps when taking on impactful systematic reviews.

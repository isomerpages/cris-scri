Project management and monitoring are crucial aspects of clinical trials that contribute to their successful execution, data integrity, subject safety, and overall efficiency.

SCRIâ€™s experienced project managers and Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) are essential for the successful execution of clinical trials, particularly in managing complex Investigator initiated trials (IITs) with multiple stakeholders. They ensure that the trial progresses efficiently, adheres to regulatory guidelines, safeguards subject safety, and produces reliable and meaningful results that foster collaborations among various academic institutions and contribute to medical advancements and improved patient care.

SCRI as a leading national Academic Research Organization, collaborates with investigators from academic institutions to offer our expertise and resources in conducting clinical research studies.

Investigator initiated trials (IITs) plays a crucial role in clinical research.Â  SCRI has specialized knowledge and experience in managing IITs, with required facilities and technologies. SCRI is well-versed in ICH-GCP to ensure studies are conducted in compliance with applicable regulations. SCRI has demonstrated to be a cost-effective and time-saving solution for academic institutions that may not have all the necessary resources in-house. By working with an external Academic Research Organization like SCRI, academic investigators can avoid potential conflicts of interest that might arise from direct industry collaborations.

SCRI has full capabilities in supporting Phase 1 to 4 clinical trials, including project management, data management, trial monitoring, biostatistics and publication.

*   Supply of information technology to SCRI clinical research operations to increase productivity
    
*   Provision of technical and user support to clinical research operations including trouble-shooting, analysis and recovery of systems and applications
    
*   Design and development of new tools, applications and technology to enhance project information collection, data management efficiency 
    
*   Sourcing and adoption of new technology and ideas in accordance with industry best practices for smooth implementation of study methodologies
    

  

The Research Informatics team is responsible for providing information technology support to SCRI clinical research studies. With their specialised knowledge in software development life cycles, the department’s trained system analysts work closely with stakeholders to offer information technology solutions that meet study needs. Through strategic planning of cost-effective solutions, the team ensures that it offers the best practice methodologies to SCRI partners. 

  

As one of the earliest institutes to adopt and set up an electronic data capture (EDC) system designed to support data capture for research studies, SCRI has helped improve the data-entry efficiency and database management of its clinical research projects. The Research Informatics team also provides its partners with training and support on the use of the systems. 

  

In addition, Research Informatics designed and developed the Randomisation (RAND) System, a user-friendly integrated randomisation and investigational product management system used by many studies. The team is working on the software development to ensure continuous improvement on the application so that the RAND system supports and meets different types of study requirements while reducing the need for labour intensive management. 

  

With the increasing complexity, size and cost of clinical trials, effective operations processing and coordination is critical. The Research Informatics team strives to support information technology needs for SCRI by customising and enhancing our current systems to improve clinical research operations while constantly sourcing for new and emerging technology and ideas.

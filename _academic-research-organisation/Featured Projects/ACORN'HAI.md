**ACORN-HAI** is the first study initiated by the network ADVANcing Clinical Evidence in Infectious Diseases (ADVANCE ID) based in NUS. This Prospective observational surveillance registry aims to form foundation for future RCTs, determine burden of disease, build local capacity and communication pipelines, and identify suitable sites for collaboration globally. 

The study will be overseen by the ACORN-HAI study hub, which mainly consists of the directors of the ADVANCE-ID network and a dedicated project manager from SCRI. This central hub will communicate with the other respective committees to engage with participating sites, ensure study implementation, adherence to protocol, and maintain quality of data collection. The study steering committee will consist of the main ACORN study principal investigators, and an expert panel (microbiologist, statistician/ epidemiologist, clinician). The study will be supported in data management, monitoring and attaining ethics approvals by the Singapore clinical research institute (SCRI). The support team will liaise closely with the central hub and respective participating sites to provide training and ensure data quality. Country-specific hubs will help to coordinate activities within the country which may include ethics applications, manpower management and data/sample storage.

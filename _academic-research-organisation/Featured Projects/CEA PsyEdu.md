CEA PsyEdu is a randomised controlled trial in Singapore. The trial aims to (1) develop a web-based postnatal psycho-educational programme for first-time mothers, (2) examine its effectiveness on maternal self-efficacy in newborn care (primary outcome), as well as social support, psychological well-being and maternal satisfaction with the postnatal support (secondary outcomes) and (3) evaluate its cost-effectiveness as compared to home-based psycho-educational programme and routine postnatal care.

Supported by the NMRC Health Services Research Competitive Research Grant (HSR CRG), this project shows novelty in designing and promoting a psycho-educational programme for first-time mothers. The study leverages on information technology to provide innovative and high quality nursing care that is efficient, potentially cost effective and evidence-based. This trial shows great potential of having a big impact on women going through childbirth.

SCRI’s Epidemiology Department harnesses its expertise to provide the project with cost-effectiveness analysis and economic evaluation. Playing a key role for this project in the design of CRFs, development of cost-effectiveness analysis plan, construction of Markov models, and support of manuscript drafting. The department hopes this study will pave the way for greater development of research projects to promote cost effective health services in the nursing field.

The manuscript of CEA PSYEDU has been accepted for publication by the Journal of Medical Internet Research.

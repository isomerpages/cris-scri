One of SCRI’s function is to take on the role as Singapore’s national academic clinical research organization to collaborate with investigators from academic institutions and offer our expertise and resources to conduct clinical research studies.

Investigator initiated trials (IITs) plays a crucial role in clinical research and optimising healthcare practice.  SCRI has specialised knowledge and experience in managing and supporting IITs, and is well-versed in ICH-GCP to ensure studies are conducted in compliance with applicable regulations. SCRI is both a cost-effective and time-saving solution for academic institutions that may not have all the necessary resources in-house. By working with SCRI, academic investigators may avoid potential conflicts of interest that might arise from using local in-house support groups.

SCRI has full capabilities to support Phase 1 to 4 clinical trials, including project management, data management, trial monitoring, and biostatistics.

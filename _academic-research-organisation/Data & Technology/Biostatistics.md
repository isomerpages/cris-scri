Evidence-based treatments and practices are critical for optimising patient care using clinical research conducted at both the national and international level. In turn, the quality of evidence depends on study design, sample sizes and conduct of the study. To optimise research efforts, SCRI's Biostatistics department helps clinicians in designing studies, selecting optimal sample size, and synthesising evidence generated from the study results. The department works with a wide range of clinical specialisms including cancer, diabetes, hypertension, infectious diseases, and optometry. Since its establishment in the early days of CTERU, the Biostatistics department has supported more than 150 studies, 150 grant proposals, 200 research papers, 200 workshops/seminars, and 1000 research consultations. The department has evolved to become a scientific reviewer for grant agencies, scientific journals, ethics bodies, and pharmaceutical companies. It is also involved in training medical and biostatistics students for study designing and grant proposal writing, thus ensuring that future generations of clinical researchers have the best skills to produce quality studies.

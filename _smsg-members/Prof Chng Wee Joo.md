<h4><strong>Prof Chng Wee Joo</strong></h4>
<p>MB ChB, PhD, FRCP (UK), FRCPath (UK), FAMS</p>
<h4><strong>Profile</strong></h4>
<p>Professor Chng Wee Joo has been appointed as the Executive Director of
the Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium since 2019. He obtained his
medical degree from the University of Leeds and did his internal medicine
residency in the United Kingdom. He completed his fellowship training in
haematology in Singapore before he obtained an A*STAR international fellowship
in 2004 to go to the Mayo Clinic for a research fellowship in multiple
myeloma genetics.</p>
<p>Professor Chng is the chair of the Asian Myeloma Network, a member of
various leading national and international professional committees, including
the International Myeloma Working Group and the American Society of Hematology,
and a former president of the Singapore Society of Hematology. In addition,
he serves on several advisory boards, steering committees for international
clinical trials, grant review panels, and conference organizing committees.
He has authored over 400 publications in several reputable journals, actively
engages in clinical trials, and has given multiple talks at important conferences
and seminars. His impactful research has won him numerous national and
global accolades including the NUHS Research Excellence Award, the International
Myeloma Foundation’s Brian GM Durie Outstanding Achievement Award, the
National Medical Excellence Outstanding Clinician Scientist Award, the
National Medical Research Council Senior Translational Research (STaR)
Award, the National University of Singapore Young Researcher Award, and
the Celgene Future Leaders in Haematology Award.</p>
<p>Professor Chng’s research focuses on the use of global genomics methods
(microarray and sequencing platforms) to study the clinical and biological
heterogeneity in haematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia,
multiple myeloma and lymphoma. Using these methods, he has identified novel
prognostic markers and molecular abnormalities in these malignancies, serving
as potential targets for therapy and providing insights into disease pathogenesis
and biology. He has strong research interest in risk stratification and
clinical trials in myeloma.</p>

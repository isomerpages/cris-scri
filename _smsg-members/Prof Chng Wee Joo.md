<h4><strong>Prof Chng Wee Joo</strong></h4>
<p>MB ChB, PhD, FRCP (UK), FRCPath (UK), FAMS</p>
<h4><strong>Profile</strong></h4>
<p>Prof Chng Wee Joo has been appointed as the Executive Director of the
Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium since 2019. He obtained his medical
degree from the University of Leeds and did his internal medicine residency
in the United Kingdom. He completed his fellowship training in haematology
in Singapore before he obtained an A*STAR international fellowship in 2004
to go to the Mayo Clinic for a research fellowship in multiple myeloma
genetics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof Chng is a member of many leading national and international professional
committees, including the former President of the Singapore Society of
Haematology, the International Myeloma Working Group and the Asian Myeloma
Network. He is also involved in several grant review committees, conference
organising committees, advisory boards and steering committees of global
clinical trials. He actively participates in clinical trials, and has authored
more than 300 publications in many reputed journals, as well as delivered
numerous talks in major conferences and seminars. His impactful research
has won him numerous national and global accolades including the NUHS Research
Excellence Award, the International Myeloma Foundation’s Brian GM Durie
Outstanding Achievement Award, the National Medical Excellence Outstanding
Clinician Scientist Award, the National Medical Research Council Senior
Translational Research (STaR) Award, the National University of Singapore
Young Researcher Award, and the Celgene Future Leaders in Haematology Award.</p>
<p>Prof Chng’s research focuses on the use of global genomics methods (microarray
and sequencing platforms) to study the clinical and biological heterogeneity
in haematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, multiple
myeloma and lymphoma. Using these methods, he has identified novel prognostic
markers and molecular abnormalities in these malignancies, serving as potential
targets for therapy and providing insights into disease pathogenesis and
biology. He has strong research interest in risk stratification and clinical
trials in myeloma.</p>

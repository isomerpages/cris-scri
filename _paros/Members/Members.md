### Members of PAROS CRN

The Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) Clinical Research Network (CRN) offers two categories of registration – Member and Guest.

As a Member of PAROS CRN, you will be able to enjoy the following exclusive benefits:

*   Participating in studies conducted under the auspices of the Network,
*   Contributing data to the Network,
*   Proposing studies to be conducted as part of PAROS CRN’s research.

In addition, you will also be invited to all PAROS open events and receive updates from us on the latest developments in the Network.

Members may be further differentiated into Executive Committee (EXCO) members and General Members. The PAROS CRN EXCO members (appointed for a period of 3 years) will provide overall direction and be the decision-maker on all major issues not limited to the acceptance, management, budgeting, conduct, authorship and publication of PAROS CRN trials or studies. General Members refer to all non-EXCO members.

Currently, membership is offered to PAROS participating countries (Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, China, Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Pakistan). If you are from a non-participating country, or would only like to be on our mailing list, you are most welcome to join PAROS as a guest.

### Guests of PAROS CRN

As a guest of PAROS CRN, you will be invited to all PAROS open events and will be on our mailing list to receive updates on the Network's latest developments.

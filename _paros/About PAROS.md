The **PAROS CRN** is a collaborative research group formed in 2010 by dedicated Pre-hospital and Emergency Care (PEC) providers conducting PEC research in the Asia-Pacific region. It promotes&nbsp;collaboration by bringing together like-minded individuals to share experiences and develop joint initiatives for the betterment of PEC.

Currently, research into PEC in the Asia-Pacific region is largely inadequate and poorly coordinated owing to the marked variations in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems and outcomes reporting. With PEC conditions such as Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) being one of the leading causes of death worldwide, the dearth in the understanding of trends and&nbsp; research in PEC underscores the urgent need for more collaborative research and good-quality intervention trials in PEC.

PAROS CRN endeavours to improve outcomes from PEC across the Asia-Pacific region through the creation of a platform to support and stimulate research into effective strategies to improve survival in PEC. The ability to reach out to countries across the Asia-Pacific region means that the Network can adopt a multi-pronged strategy&nbsp;that targets key stakeholders such as the community, EMS and the hospitals in its vision to improve PEC outcomes. By offering practical ways of monitoring and meaningful measurement of PEC outcomes, PAROS CRN has an enormous potential to contribute significantly to PEC research, regardless of whether they are epidemiological studies or clinical trials. As a first step, PAROS CRN has identified OHCA as one of its main thrusts. The Network will gather valuable information on OHCA and deepen the understanding of the EMS systems in the region&nbsp;to devise strategies that improve survival. An IRB&nbsp;master template of an OHCA study initiated by Prof Marcus Ong can be found&nbsp;[here](/paros/source-documents).

Mission
-------

To improve outcomes from Pre-hospital and Emergency Care across the Asia-Pacific region by promoting high quality research into resuscitation

Vision
------

Improving outcomes from Pre-hospital and Emergency Care across the Asia-Pacific region

Value to Singapore and the Region
---------------------------------

PAROS CRN endeavours to answer important questions for the development and revisions&nbsp;of Pre-hospital and Emergency Care (PEC) policies. This research has a major social value&nbsp;as it aims to improve outcomes from PEC,&nbsp;including survival rates across the Asia-Pacific region. It will&nbsp;also help to further develop the necessary research infrastructure and strengthen the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) treatment capability in the region.

Set to be the driving force for PEC research and development in the Asia-Pacific region, PAROS CRN will also establish a role for Singapore as a networking hub and as a contact point for interested research partners. PAROS CRN has forged ties with the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) in the USA, showcasing collaboration with parties beyond the Asia-Pacific region. PAROS CRN is also affiliated to the Asian Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Council and the Asian Relations Ad Hoc Committee of the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP).

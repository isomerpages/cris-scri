Introduction
------------

The Asian Association for Emergency Medical Services&nbsp;was first founded in 2009 in Busan, Korea.&nbsp; Recognising that the EMS systems in Asia have been under-developed and immature because of the short history of development in this part of the world, the Asian Association for Emergency Medical Services aims to promote and advocate pre-hospital care / EMS in Asia.

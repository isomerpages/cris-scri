#### Studies under PAROS CRN

_**Ongoing Research: International Study on Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA)**_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Background

Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCAs) are a global health concern. There is an urgent need to better understand the key factors that affect OHCA survival, and to develop methods to improve OHCA survival.

#### Objectives

This international study has the following objectives:

*   Understand OHCA as a disease in Asia
*   Describe current pre-hospital systems in the Asia-Pacific
*   Provide international benchmarking and study of best practices
*   Impact community awareness and change attitudes towards OHCA
*   Improve OHCA survival by system- / community-level interventions.

#### Methods

The Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) Clinical Research Network (CRN) provides a user-friendly infrastructure to conduct patient-oriented, clinical, translational or service systems research in a high quality and cost-effective manner. The research group will conduct the first Pan-Asian descriptive study on Pre-hospital and Emergency Care (PEC) Systems to establish a system-wide comparison of resuscitation outcomes across the Asia-Pacific region. The research group will also conduct a National Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Outcomes Study in Singapore as part of a Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes comparative study. PAROS CRN’s data capture methods (available via direct entry online or export field entry) is closely modelled after that used in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES), an initiative based in Atlanta, USA, and funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Background

The ability to save lives in pre-hospital setting is dependent on the ability to respond to the patients outside hospitals efficiently and effectively. With out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) and prehospital care fast becoming a global health concern, it is inevitable that the pressure on the EMS systems to respond and resuscitate patients will increase, especially in the light of an aging and growing population. As one of the youngest specialties, emergency medicine and EMS Systems has a relatively short history of development. Independent development and varied amounts of resource commitment across countries has led to variations among EMS systems. Yet, there is no knowing how similar or dissimilar EMS systems in the Asia-Pacific region are and, more fundamentally, whether systemic characteristics can have an impact on resuscitation outcomes.

Spearheaded by Dr Sang Do Shin from Seoul (Co- Chair of PAROS), there is now a concerted effort to characterize the EMS systems in Asia-Pacific region. Information drawn from this study can then be used as the baseline characteristics for future studies involving the region.

#### Methods

A survey in the form of a questionnaire will be conducted across the Network. The variables can be found [here](/files/PAROS/Research/6_ems_your_project_variables.pdf).

#### Update

The paper has been submitted and accepted by Prehospital Emergency Care.

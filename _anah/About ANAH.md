### About ANAH

•	ANAH (ASEAN Network of Adrenal Hypertension) is a collaborative research network started in 2022 by recognized disease experts in Southeast Asia. ANAH unites experts from Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 

•	Adrenal hypertension occurs when the adrenal glands produce too much hormone(s) leading to medical conditions such as Pheochromocytoma, Cushing’s syndrome, and Primary aldosteronism. While adrenal hypertension affects 5-20% of all patients with hypertension, many are left undiagnosed and inadequately treated, leading to heart attacks, strokes, and chronic kidney disease.

•	While most adrenal tumors are benign, some may be malignant (e.g., adrenocortical cancer, or metastatic pheochromocytoma) requiring early diagnosis and surgical resection. In addition, patients with adrenal failure (insufficiency) are at risk of deteriorating rapidly if not recognized as a medical emergency. 

•	ANAH is set up to increase the awareness and improve screening of adrenal hypertension to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients with curable forms of hypertension. 

### Aims of ANAH

To create a platform for clinicians, scientists, and healthcare professionals, to collaborate for research and improve education in Adrenal conditions, such as:

•	Adrenal Hypertension: Primary Aldosteronism, Pheochromocytoma, Cushing’s syndrome

•	Adrenal tumours: Adrenocortical carcinoma, Adrenal incidentalomas

•	Adrenal Insufficiency

### Mission

To improve health outcomes and quality of life in individuals affected by Adrenal Hypertension throughout the ASEAN region.

### Vision

ANAH aspires that every individual with Adrenal Hypertension can receive timely and equitable access to care, resources and support.

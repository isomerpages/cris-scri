<h4>Prof Derek Hausenloy</h4>
<p>Prof Derek Hausenloy is Professor in the Cardiovascular &amp; Metabolic
Disorders Signature Programme, Duke-National University of Singapore Medical
School, and Research Director and Senior Consultant Cardiologist at the
National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore.</p>
<p>He is also Professor in the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University
College London, UK. He is a National Medical Research Council STaR Investigator
Award who conducts basic, translational and clinical research in the areas
of ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, cardioprotection, and cardiac
MRI.</p>
<p>His main research focus is on discovering novel therapies for protecting
the heart against acute ischaemia/reperfusion injury and heart failure.
His research ranges from cellular and animal disease models of cardiovascular
disease to proof-of-concept clinical studies in acute myocardial infarction,
heart failure and cardiac bypass surgery patients, and finally to large
multi-centre randomised clinical trials focused on clinical outcomes. He
also uses human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to model cardiomyopathies to
elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets
and has interests in cardiac MRI, nanotechnology for drug delivery, and
discovering new treatment targets for peripheral arterial disease.</p>
<p>He has been a PI on over 40 research grants, has authored over 350 papers
(H-index 101), and was named Highly Cited Researcher by Clarivate Analytics
(awarded to the top 1% of researchers worldwide) in 2018, 2020, 2021, and

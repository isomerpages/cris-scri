<h4>Dr Diana Foo</h4>
<p>Dr Diana Foo is a senior clinician-researcher and Director of the Human
Physiology Laboratory at Sarawak General Hospital Clinical Research Centre.
Trained as a medical doctor, she embarked on a less conventional path as
a clinician-researcher in 2013, driven by a deep passion for cardiovascular
prevention and meaningful patient impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Her research focuses on echocardiography (diastology, strain imaging),
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), cardiometabolic
disease, atrial fibrillation, and digital health. Much of her work is dedicated
to integrating advanced diagnostics and modern technologies at the interface
between primary care and tertiary hospitals to support early detection
and management for cardiovascular disease prevention.</p>
<p>Dr Foo has led various investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored studies
as Principal Investigator. She receives research grants from the Ministry
of Health Malaysia, industry collaborators, and international partners,
and currently serves on international steering committees for several global
studies. Since 2017, as Director of the Human Physiology Lab, she has led
its transformation from a facility primarily supporting early-phase clinical
trials into a medtech research hub for cardiovascular innovation.</p>
<p>Her work has been recognised with multiple Young Investigator Awards from
national and regional cardiology societies. In 2023, she became the first
Malaysian selected as a World Heart Federation Emerging Leader in digital
health and cardiovascular disease prevention, and was also named one of
Malaysia’s Ten Outstanding Young Malaysians (TOYM) for academic leadership
and accomplishments.</p>
<p>Beyond research, Dr Foo contributes actively to national echocardiography
education and serves as teaching and exam faculty for the National Heart
Association of Malaysia’s Basic Echocardiography Certification and hands-on
training programmes. As a young leader, her work reflects a strong commitment
to the translational impact of research, cross-sector and interdisciplinary
partnerships, and mentoring young research talents within the public healthcare
system.</p>

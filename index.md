  Established in 2008, the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) was set
  up as the national academic clinical research organisation to enhance the
  standards of clinical research in Singapore by developing core capabilities,
  infrastructure and scientific leadership for clinical research. 


  In 2021, SCRI was appointed as the national coordinating body to implement the national clinical trial strategy and enhance Singaporeâ€™s clinical trial ecosystem.


  This is accomplished through the deployment of innovative technologies and processes, and strategic coordination of ecosystem capabilities and infrastructure to achieve synergies that will enhance the clinical research ecosystem aimed towards a healthier community and better patient outcomes.

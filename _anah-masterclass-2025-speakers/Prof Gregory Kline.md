<h4>Profile</h4>
<p>Dr. Gregory Kline is a clinician-researcher and Professor of Medicine
at the University of Calgary in Canada. On faculty since 2001, and as Division
Chief 2012-2015, his career has focused upon what is commonly known as
"secondary hypertension" - primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, and
hypercortisolism among others. He directs a nationally recognized Endocrine
Hypertension Clinic and leads the Calgary Adrenal Research Group, a multi-disciplinary
team of clinicians and researchers in adrenal disorders. He presently lists
over 150 peer-reviewed publications, the majority of which span topics
in adrenal hypertension. The central theme of his work is to improve the
understanding and detection of specific endocrine hypertension disorders
which may be amenable to surgical cure. Outside of his work at the university,
he has a passion for training young physicians, particularly those practicing
in emerging nations' health systems.</p>

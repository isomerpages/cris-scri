<h4>Profile</h4>
<p>I am an endocrinologist and adrenal specialist in Bangkok. I completed
my postdoctoral research fellowship at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard
Medical School, with a focus on primary aldosteronism, aldosterone physiology,
and the genetics of salt-sensitive hypertension. Since returning to Thailand,
I have remained actively involved in both national and international endocrine
communities. I lead local educational initiatives, collaborate regionally
through the ASEAN Adrenal Network, and serve as a steering committee member
of the Endocrine Society’s Adrenal and Pituitary Special Interest Group.</p>

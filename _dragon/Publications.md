    **Abstract**
    
    Multinational studies have reported monogenic etiologies in 25%-30% of children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Such large studies are lacking in Asia. We established Deciphering Diversities: Renal Asian Genetics Network (DRAGoN) and aimed to describe the genetic and clinical spectrums in Asians. We prospectively studied a cohort of 183 probands with suspected genetic glomerulopathies from South and Southeast Asia, of whom 17% had positive family history. Using multi-gene panel sequencing, we detected pathogenic variants in 26 (14%) probands, of whom one-third had COL4A4 or COL4A5 variants (n = 9, 5%). Of those with COL4A5 defects, only 25% had features suggestive of Alport syndrome. Besides traditional predictors for genetic disease (positive family history and extrarenal malformations), we identified novel predictors, namely older age (6.2 vs. 2.4 years; p = 0.001), hematuria (OR 5.6; 95% CI 2.1-14.8; p &lt; 0.001), and proteinuria in the absence of nephrotic syndrome (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.8-11.8; p = 0.001) at first manifestation. Among patients who first presented with proteinuria without nephrotic syndrome, the genetic diagnostic rates were &gt;60% when a second risk factor (positive family history or extrarenal manifestation) co-existed. The genetic spectrum of glomerulopathies appears different in Asia. Collagen IV genes may be included in sequencing panels even when suggestive clinical features are absent.

**How to Reach Us**
===================

The mission of the AHCC network is to conduct preventive and therapeutic trials in HCC, carry out translational research in this field and develop training and educational programs pertaining to HCC. With more than 20 years of experience in conducting multi-centre, multi-national clinical trials, the AHCC network is a well-established platform that only ensures top quality clinical studies are conducted.

The AHCC Trials Group Secretariat acts as the single point of contact as well as the centre of all administrative and operational procedures for the network. The Secretariat is part of the National Cancer Centre Singapore, but outsources many of its functions to other agencies, in particular the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI).

The AHCC Trials Group and its partners comprise investigators, coordinators, and professionals in various supporting specialties with significant expertise in:

*   Protocol development and feasibility evaluation,
*   Budget allocation and contract negotiation,
*   Handling institutional procedures in various countries,
*   Executing, managing and monitoring studies in progress, and
*   Collecting and analysing data returned from the studies.

With over 50 participating sites, the AHCC Trials Group enables connection with professionals from various countries with different expertise within the AHCC network. The network facilitates support between members as well as broader collaboration between members and other experts within participating institutions and beyond.

The AHCC Trials Group has access to a diverse patient population around the Asia-Pacific region, allowing investigators to conduct quality research and produce high-impact results due to their applicability across different populations in the region. Variation seen in drug response, among different populations can also be easily addressed within the network.

The AHCC06 (SIRveNIB) trial had its second Interim Analysis in Singapore on 27 October 2014. The objective of the second analysis is to continue review the progress, safety and efficacy of the trial, and to make recommendations on the future direction and conduct of the trial.&nbsp;

We are pleased to share that the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) found the overall conduct of the trial is good, protocol has been well executed and the data is solid and acceptable.

A DSMB is an independent group of experts who monitor safety of patients and treatment efficacy data while a clinical trial is ongoing. The board comprised of Dr Thomas Leung (Chairman), Prof David Machin and Prof Bruno Sangro.

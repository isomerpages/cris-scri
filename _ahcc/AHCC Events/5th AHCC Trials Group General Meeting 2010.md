The 5th AHCC Trials Group General Meeting was successfully held at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore on 6 February 2010. The opening address was given by A/Prof Pierce Chow, Clinical Coordinator of AHCC Trials Group.

We were honoured to invite Dr Thomas Leung from the Hong Kong Sanatorium and Dr Donald Poon from the National Cancer Centre of Singapore to present their lectures.

Local and overseas delegates attended the afternoon closed door session, during which results of previous AHCC initiated trials and upcoming trials were presented. It was heartening to have many positive responses from clinicians from across the Asia-Pacific region.

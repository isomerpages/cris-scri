There was a good line-up of scientific and clinical speakers who shared their extensive research and clinical experience with HCC.

The Director of the National Cancer Centre Singapore and the Group Chair of the AHCC Trials Group, Professor Soo Khee Chee, gave his welcome address followed by a short introduction to the AHCC Trials Group by the Protocol Chair of the AHCC Trials Group, Professor Pierce Chow. Dr Zhai Wei Wei, Senior Research Scientist at the Genome Institute of Singapore, shared about using evolutionary and population genetic approaches in HCC. Professor Sven Pettersson from Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, presented on the human microbiome and HCC while Associate Professor Ken Sung Wing Kin from the National University of Singapore and Genome Institute of Singapore spoke about the relevance of Hepatitis B genotype in HCC.

Clinical speakers that took part in the scientific program were Professor Simone Strasser from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Australia and Professor Khin Maung Win from Yangon GI and Liver Centre, Myanmar. Professor Strasser shared about her extensive clinical experience in treating HCC in Australia and Professor Khin Maung Win presented on the challenges faced in managing HCC in Myanmar.

Professor Chow also shared on the recommendations from the Data Monitoring Committee in regards to the 2nd Interim Analysis.

Several ongoing pilot studies on HCC were also presented at the meeting. Dr Teo Jin Yao from Singapore General Hospital talked about an ongoing pilot study on hypertrophy of the contralateral lobe after SIRT. Professor Pierce Chow also presented on two pilot studies with the Genome Institute of Singapore on HCC tumor heterogeneity and HBV genotypes in HCC. An exploratory study on the microbiome and HCC conducted by both National Cancer Centre Singapore and Nanyang Technological University was also presented during the meeting. The General Meeting concluded with a dinner reception with all the AHCC Trials Group members followed by a Night Bus Tour of Singapore.

Overall, the first AHCC Trials Group Scientific Forum and General Meeting was a stimulating learning and sharing experience for scientific and clinical participants alike. The study team would like to thank the Investigators, AHCC Trials Group Members, distinguished speakers and sponsors for making this event a success.
